<h2>Chicago : 2004</h2>
<h3>Walter</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">I</span>t had been a
beginner&#8217;s winter. Pretty morning snowfalls with all of the magic and none of
the storm. Each accumulation had been followed in good stead by a few days of
drain-clearing rain, whose late-night swilling against the glass of Walter
Choo&#8217;s bedroom windows drummed him into the deepest sleep that he&#8217;d known since
his late wife Jinny had been diagnosed with grade-two sarcoma ten years
before. Jack Frost had gone soft&#151;at least on northern Illinois, at least this
year.</p>

<p class="Story">Another Jack, Jack
Jaffrey, vice president and director of Midwest sales for Fenniskrante, Inc., was
also bucking expectations this year. <i>He&#8217;d called a meeting in the middle of
March.</i> Walter and the other eighty-eight Midwest regional managers were to
report to Fenniskrante&#8217;s world headquarters in downtown Chicago on March 15,
two weeks before the end of the company&#8217;s financial year. </p>

<p class="Story">As usual, Walter
had worked with his reps to schedule their vacations right before the
respective ends of the previous three quarters, to artificially skew their
sales data downwards. As usual, Walter&#8217;s territory had still been tracking in
the top twenty in the country all year. As usual, he had approved no vacation
time for February or March, and his reps knew better than to call in sick. Walter was going into the final month of the sales year all burners on. Most years
around this time, he stayed up late nights puzzling out the
puzzlers&#151;charismatic, smart young guys who pulled low numbers, or good drugs
that his best reps couldn&#8217;t sell&#151;but this year Walter knew exactly where the
slack was on his team. It was just a matter of putting the pressure on in the
right ways at the right times. </p>

<p class="Story">The last thing that
Walter had expected was for Jack Jaffrey to help him out by calling an
eleventh-hour mandatory meeting at HQ for a group that included last year&#8217;s
number-three sales manager, Peter Jensen (a Mormon who managed a
territory in north Michigan), and last year&#8217;s number-seven manager, Bette
Warwick, the white-haired former college tennis champ who managed a large chunk
of Cleveland, Ohio. Both were at least a plane ride and El train ride away
from the mid-century office tower that was an easy forty-five-minute commute
from Walter&#8217;s home in Naperville, Illinois. Every second counted in March, and
neither Peter nor Bette could have been happy about leaving their territories
for a meeting whose subject Jack Jaffrey&#8217;s secretary had declined to state in
the invitation.</p>

<p class="Story">Of course, Walter&#8217;s
daughter Marin had chosen the last two weeks of February
to come home from Asia. Walter was glad that she was back safe, but Marin, at twenty-four, was
still very much the star pupil of the dippy socialists on payroll at Naperville
Prep. Marin had never approved of Walter&#8217;s work, had early on been trained to disdain &#147;corporate evil&#148; as a matter of course (as opposed to what, he always
wondered, &#147;bureaucratic good?&#148;) Such high-mindedness, Walter noted to himself,
didn&#8217;t keep Marin from raiding his Fenniskrante sample closet for antibiotics
and birth control pills whenever she was home. </p>

<p class="Story">This was Walter&#8217;s
year for number one&#151;all year long he had felt it. The last thing he needed was
the buzz kill and betrayal of righteous doubt kicking up her feet on his living
room coffee table.</p>

<p class="Story">So Walter was
relieved when Marin announced at breakfast one morning that she had booked a
flight to San Francisco for the next day, along with a room at a commuter hotel
near Union Square at a weekly rate. She&#8217;d said that she would stay at the
hotel until she found a suitable apartment in the area, and that she had enough
money saved to tide herself over until she found a new job. </p>

<p class="last">That
night, Walter had taken Marin out to a goodbye dinner at her favorite place, a
Sicilian restaurant in the city that still dressed the tables with
red-and-white checkered tablecloths, tea candles in clear glass votives, and
baskets of crunchy bread twigs. At dinner, Marin told him the thing that he
thought had to be a joke, but you could never tell with Marin. If it wasn&#8217;t a
joke, it was absolutely crazy, but he didn&#8217;t have time to worry about his
twenty-four-year-old daughter&#8217;s international financial entanglements at the
moment. In a few weeks, Walter would or would not be the manager of
Fenniskrante&#8217;s highest-selling territory in America, and he would deal with
Marin then.</p>

<p class="first">Walter pulled into
the shadow of the big black sheath of 220 South Wacker and into the
Fenniskrante garage twenty minutes before the appointed time (three
p.m.)&#151;plenty of time to go through security and get tidied up in the men&#8217;s room
before the meeting. He got his barcoded guest ID sticker, and the security guy
manually beeped him through the turnstile. Walter got into an empty elevator,
pressed &#147;24,&#148; and saw the doors close on a rain-soaked Bette Warwick rushing up
and wheeling her black carry-on behind her. Walter, as he often did, thought of  Sun Tzu:</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;With regard to
narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned
and await the advent of the enemy.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter pressed the
door-open button. The doors opened, and in wheeled a grateful Bette. Walter
pressed &#147;24&#148; again, the doors closed, and Walter felt the 20th century miracle
of gearless traction hoist mechanics pull them smoothly off the
ground.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cleveland!&#148; Walter
said. &#147;How are you?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not bad, Choo&#133;
although I think those over-the-counter Immuno-Boost tablets are cutting into
my Respiatin sales.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Crap, she must be
doing well in Respiatin this year</i>, Walter thought. &#147;Just a fad, Cleveland,&#148;
he said. &#147;Like Zinc-It, remember? People still want their prescription
antibiotics at the end of the day.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Bette looked at him
and looked away, as if watching a bunk serve go out of bounds. &#147;So did you put
Jaffrey up to this, Choo?&#148; she asked. &#147;Call a mandatory meeting on March 15 in
your territory?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Well,
technically, downtown Chicago is Barney Wiig&#8217;s territory, but, no, I had
nothing to do with this assemblage of the troops,&#148; Walter said. </p>

<p class="first">Well-groomed men
and women in their thirties and forties, along with a handful of dinosaurs like
Walter and Bette, filled the Angilexin Room on the twenty-fourth floor. Eighty-nine of the best drug sales people in the country: the room smelled and
sounded <i>chemical</i>. Walter avoided the scattered empty seats and found an
empty spot of wall twenty feet from the front of the room to lean against. Seated at the end of the row in front of Walter was a young blond manager
aggressively flirting with a pretty redhead in glasses. The man&#8217;s name was
Paul something, or maybe Jake. Walter couldn&#8217;t remember.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m telling you,
these girls are the future of this business,&#148; Paul/Jake was saying. &#147;The doctors
all have their types, you just have to figure out what it is. A lot of the
married ones like Tracey, she&#8217;s my classy blonde southern belle. The young
ones like Kim, the California party girl. The Asians are the hardest to figure
out, because they&#8217;re so shy they don&#8217;t even want to talk to a pretty woman, but
most of them like Casey, she&#8217;s the sweet but sexy librarian type. The Asians,
they won&#8217;t even talk to her, they&#8217;ll just sign for the samples, but they&#8217;ll go
back and write half your &#8216;scripts after ten minutes with Casey.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The redhead shook
her head. &#147;This is why my PCP and ob/gyn are both women,&#148; she said. &#147;I&#8217;ve
lost so much respect for male doctors working in this business.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You shouldn&#8217;t
complain,&#148; said Paul/Jake. &#147;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ve gotten a few Green Bay MDs to
write a &#8216;script or two.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;More than <i>two</i>,&#148;
said the redhead.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter crossed his
arms across his chest and exhaled a single curt, train engine chug through his
nose. It was reps like these two that gave all of them a bad name. Walter had
learned to put up with the frattier elements of his profession over the
years&#151;it wasn&#8217;t exactly easy finding smart, capable people willing to move to
Barstow and Dubuque to sell drugs. Managers like Paul/Jake and Paul/Jake&#8217;s
redhead friend got the job done in some thankless corners of the country, but
to really succeed at this job over the long run, on a national level, you had
to have a management vision a little bit more complex than a Ford-era Aaron
Spelling television franchise.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s territory
was tracking fourth in the country because he trained his reps to first and
foremost be credible sources of information (about anything&#151;pharmacology,
baseball, Renaissance painting, whatever) to their physicians. Walter&#8217;s reps
knew that on his visits, Walter would expect them to display not only a
comprehensive knowledge of their own drugs and the sales pitches that had been
drilled into them during training (the typical objective of a regional manager
visit), but also their literacy in national pharmaceutical and health care
industry developments (many an I-290 traffic jam had been spent explicating the
rocky history of the U.S. health insurance system to a new rep) as well as
general current affairs. </p>

<p class="Story">Sports were always
good to keep up with, but if Walter sensed that this was old hat for a rep,
Walter would encourage that rep to go outside of his comfort zone and learn
about local theater or restaurants. Perhaps most famously, Walter quizzed all
of his reps regularly and in-depth on what books they were reading. Some of
them could have skated by by reading the book reviews in <i>USA Today</i> and a
Cliffs Notes or two, but Walter was pretty sure that under his wing most of his
reps got into the habit of reading at least a book a month. He&#8217;d run into one
of his old reps at the mall one day, a sharp young thing who&#8217;d repped for him
for three years straight out of undergrad and then gone on to get her Master&#8217;s
in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. She&#8217;d said that she&#8217;d read
more books while working as a Fenniskrante sales rep than as a grad student at
an Ivy League university.</p>

<p class="Story">All of this
aggressive self-edification prepared each of Walter&#8217;s reps to, while on a
routine visit to a doctor&#8217;s office, enter into almost any topic of
conversation, and contribute in an organic and substantive way. Once this
happened often enough, once a doctor began referring often enough to that
interesting thing that the Fenniskrante rep had said about mountain zebras or
the White Sox bullpen or that new Mexican restaurant in Oak Park, then doctors
and nurses began to trust his reps, and by extension their company and their
drugs. This was what na&#239;ve people like Marin and amateurs like Paul/Jake didn&#8217;t
understand about drug sales: at the end of the day it wasn&#8217;t about using sexy marketing
gimmicks to pull the wool over some hapless physician&#8217;s eyes. It was about
trust. You can&#8217;t fake trust, and you certainly can&#8217;t pull it out of thin air.</p>

<p class="Story">Peter Jensen was in
the back corner of the Angilexin Room talking to a short-haired woman in a
beige pants suit. Peter was ten years younger than Walter and had already been
ranked number-one manager in the country twice. Peter had gone to college in
Ann Arbor, and tended to credit his network of connections in the region for
his success, but he was also an excellent salesman. He&#8217;d gotten his start
repping for psych and neuro, and it was easy to see why he&#8217;d been placed
there. Unflappably sunny and enthusiastic about the charms of life in a state
with over three thousand miles of shoreline, Peter Jensen was a walking
advertisement for Betrufel, Fenniskrante&#8217;s $3.5 billion antidepressant. </p>

<p class="Story">The blinds were
drawn over all of the windows in the Angilexin Room except for the one behind
Peter. Beating against it was gray rain from a gray sky.</p>

<p class="Story">Jack Jaffrey
entered the room. Jaffrey was in his mid-fifties, like Walter. A tall,
handsome, big-shouldered ex-Marine, Jaffrey fancied himself a different sort of
senior executive: he ordered beer at lunch, had three purple plastic Respiatin
mini-basketball hoops set up in his office (all within throwing distance from
his desk chair), and encouraged his regional managers to not exclude &#147;color&#148;
from their quarterly performance reports on their reps&#151;in fact, as all of his
managers knew, the saltier the outtakes from the field, the better.</p>

<p class="Story">Jaffrey made his
way to the front of the room and sat on the edge of the table. The room quieted.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Isn&#8217;t Chicago lovely this time of year?&#148; Jaffrey said, to mild chuckling from his audience of sales managers. &#147;So I know that many of you are wondering why I am calling this meeting now, two weeks before the proverbial crap hits the fan.&#148; </p>
<p class="Story">Jaffrey stood up, clasped his hands together. </p>
<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve been in this business a long time. I&#8217;m not saying how long, but trust me. And, many of you know that I was a drama major in college.  I could go on and on about how that was the best business education I could have ever had. <i>The Merchant of Venice? Glengarry Glen Ross?</i>&#151;that&#8217;s Management 101, people. <i>†</i>However, one of my very favorite classes was called the History of American Entertainment. I&#8217;ve often thought that the life of a pharmaceutical sales rep is a lot like that of a vaudeville performer. We learn our routines then travel from town to town and, face-to-face with our audience, we deliver the goods. We either fall flat on our faces, or we connect. We convince a pediatrician in Kansas of Respiatin&#8217;s superior efficacy for strep throat. Or an HMO in Cincinnati to add Identol to their formulary.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Identol was
Fenniskrante&#8217;s statin and one of the most popular cholesterol-lowering drugs on
the market.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What we do takes
just as much physical stamina and &#8216;chutzpah&#8217; as a tap dance routine at the
Palace Theater,&#148; Jaffrey continued. &#147;However, for all of vaudeville&#8217;s
&#8216;chutzpah,&#8217; after the American public got wind of a little invention called the
motion picture, vaudeville went extinct. So, many of these old performers who
were perfect for vaudeville because they did one or two things really well&#151;they
couldn&#8217;t sustain movie careers with their one or two things. The rules changed
on them. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening to us: the rules are
changing. If it were only the new technology it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. It&#8217;s this
new culture of self-policing at hospitals and clinics too. I know that a lot
of you have been complaining that it&#8217;s a full-time job just keeping track of
who doesn&#8217;t allow what these days.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">A lot of the
regional managers, including Bette Warwick and Peter Jensen, nodded in
agreement at this sentiment.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If it isn&#8217;t &#8216;no
food,&#8217; it&#8217;s &#8216;no free pens,&#8217; or you have to wear a big laminated orange badge,
as if doctors don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re a sales rep anyway,&#148; Jaffrey said.</p>

<p class="Story">Bette raised her
hand, and Jaffrey called on her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What kills me are
these voucher systems some of the clinics are starting to enforce,&#148; Bette
said. &#147;The clinic gives the doctors their monthly allotment of vouchers, and
then they go online and have to choose which free samples their patients need
most. It&#8217;s the biggest load of bureaucratic b.s. I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone laughed,
and several of the other managers applauded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, all of it can
be incredibly frustrating,&#148; Jaffrey said. &#147;If that wasn&#8217;t enough, we&#8217;ve got
measures on five state ballots this year, in California, West Virginia,
Maryland, Minnesota, and Iowa&#151;all seeking to regulate our access to physicians
and prescription-writing data. And the powers-that-be have taken notice. There is a small but very vocal element in corporate that wants to shave the
sales budget, reallocating at least $45 million to internet and television
marketing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter did the
math&#151;there was about a third of that in salaries and bonuses crammed into the
Angilexin Room on this rainy March afternoon. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Which is why all
of you are here today. Our sales numbers are down this year. Not by a lot&#133;
but they&#8217;re down. This is not the year to be down. We need to blow
corporate&#8217;s mind this year. We need to show them that we are not just
overpriced delivery men. Even with all the regulation and self-policing, we
are the one truly direct link that the number-one drug company in the world has
to doctors all around America!&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">The room broke into
an enthusiastic round of applause. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know it&#151;you know
it,&#148; Jaffrey said. &#147;So let&#8217;s go out there and show corporate what it doesn&#8217;t
know!&#148;</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">Y</span><i>ou don&#8217;t know what
you don&#8217;t know.</i></p>

<p class="Story">Will used to say
that, as an excuse for the stupidity of other people. Marin hadn&#8217;t really
understood the saying yet&#151;she preferred making fun of stupid people for the
obvious things that they didn&#8217;t know. </p>

<p class="Story">She had arrived ten
minutes early to the restaurant that her friend Ben had suggested, Vaudeville,
the one-month-old tenant of the northeast corner of a quickly gentrifying
intersection in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission neighborhood. Vaudeville&#8217;s front room
was crowded with cliques of young people dressed like they had come straight
from M.F.A. crit. The air smelled a pleasing combination of caramel, butter,
sage, fried potatoes, aftershave, wool fibers, and beer. The walls and ceiling
were painted black; on the wall opposite the bar hung a large black-and-white
photograph of a bowler hat, cane, and costume moustache suspended in mid-air on
black ribbons. A rock song with a catchy vibraphone hook was playing. Marin
didn&#8217;t know the song, and she had no idea that, on the Friday night of her
first full week back on Pacific Standard Time, she was in possession of a
precious commodity: an eight o&#8217;clock reservation at the hottest restaurant in
the hippest neighborhood in a city that in the past year and a half had become
the unsung but true capital of the most compulsory popular subculture since hip
hop. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had just
assumed that everyone else had liked the name Vaudeville, too.</p>

<p class="Story">You don&#8217;t know what
you don&#8217;t know. Marin knew the following fact about the rainforest: one acre
of primary growth rainforest contains approximately nine hundred species of
plants. She knew that because she had just spent sixteen months living in a
bona fide rainforest, and one hears many such facts about the rainforest while
living in a bona fide rainforest. Marin also knew that while hiking through a
bona fide rainforest&#151;underneath miles of mostly featureless canopy,
bloodsucking insects pecking around one&#8217;s arms and neck for a shallow vein,
sweating buckets in an interminable humidity and heat&#151;even the most
appreciative observer could be forgiven for not being impressed with the
density of cellular data that surrounded her. </p>

<p class="Story">In this room, the species diversity of the living population was exactly
singular. <i>Homo sapiens </i>had claimed these 2,500
square-feet in full. And yet, Marin could not give a <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>&#8217;s
<i>gluteas maximus</i>. She may not have been aware of its cultural
importance, but she knew that she really, really liked this room. How had she
ever left these smells? These sounds? These <i>clothes</i>: salmon-pink and
butter-yellow merino wool scarves, distressed gray denim miniskirts, patent
leather ballet flats, cabled tangerine sweater vests, white pea coats accented
with bright red buttons, beaded baby doll dresses, fuzzy cowl-neck sweaters,
aubergine suede jackets, and on and on. </p>

<p class="last">Marin
knew the arguments: there was nothing in this room except consumer capitalism
as usual, that cunning, invisible-handed behemoth that gorged itself on the
authentic diversity of the natural world, produced an ersatz diversity of
commodities in its stead, and reaped the profits. However, after sixteen
months living in a bona fide rainforest, Marin had come to the conclusion that
the authentic diversity of the natural world consisted mainly of vegetables and
bugs.</p>

<p class="first">Not knowing what
she didn&#8217;t know, Marin had assumed that, since her friend Ben had started
dating his girlfriend, Judith, a year and a half before, they had probably
broken up by now. Marin had no idea about her complete ignorance of the fact
that starting at around age twenty-four, Marin&#8217;s own age, when people have been
dating for a year and a half and have met each other&#8217;s families and lived
together and nothing disastrous has happened, they no longer break up&#151;they get
engaged.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben&#8217;s
girlfriend was not twenty-four, but Ben himself was. In fact, he was the kind
of twenty-four that was working two part-time jobs: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays as an assistant in an art gallery in downtown San Francisco and Mondays
and Thursdays as a contributing writer for a small architecture and design
magazine. He didn&#8217;t have health insurance and was barely scraping together a
combined gross annual salary of $27,000 a year.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had met the
girlfriend, a Taiwanese-American woman named Judith, at a party in 2002, a few
months before Marin had quit her job at the Pac Development Bank and moved to
Borneo. Judith worked for a local
public-interest lobbying group as the director of their health care reform
activities. Marin had heard everything from thirty to forty-two in terms of
Judith&#8217;s age&#151;thirty-six from the most reliable source. Judith looked
thirty. Of course, she was so gorgeous that her age both didn&#8217;t really matter
and was the subject of much speculation in certain Bay Area circles. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben arrived, as
always, somehow just seconds before the hostess called his and Marin&#8217;s table.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You said Judith&#8217;s
out of town?&#148; Marin said as the hostess pulled two menus from her stash.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, she&#8217;s in
Sacramento,&#148; Ben said. Specifically, he explained, Judith was meeting with the
governor&#8217;s office to discuss Proposition 66A, a bill up for vote by California
voters in November that, if passed, would make illegal promotional gifts and
other in-kind payments by pharmaceutical sales teams to physicians. Prop 66A would
also eliminate the loophole that allowed drug companies unfettered access to
doctors&#8217; prescription-writing histories. Judith and the organization that she
worked for, BAARC, the Bay Advocacy and Research Coalition, were pro-Prop 66A,
and they hoped to convince the governor to endorse the bill. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had to smile
at the dead-serious nonsense inherent in the name &#147;Prop 66A,&#148; a nearly perfect
self-parody of California politics, and felt reassured that certain
fundamentals had not changed in her absence.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Ben were
seated at a small table at the center of Vaudeville&#8217;s dining room. A white
ogee molding ran along the circumference of the windowless room at waist
level. Below the molding, a pretty Old World red brick was exposed, and the
smooth wall above it was painted a shade of hot pink that somehow was not
obnoxious. Hanging on the pink wall, staggered between large oval
art-nouveau giltwood mirrors, were eight four-foot by four-foot paintings
on wood. The colorful paintings were collage-like compositions of pithy texts
in ornate carnival fonts, beautiful caricatures of vaudeville dancers and
tramps, and other nostalgic images of folk Americana: blue diner plates of
pancakes and sausage links, vintage road signs, and saxophones.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you admiring
the Rocco Morrises?&#148; Ben asked Marin. &#147;He lives a couple blocks from here, you
know. He did invent all this, &#8216;the Mission School&#8217; or whatever. I doubt that
he even knows his paintings are here. The guy who opened this place bought
them directly from the collector in Japan that Phillip sold them to eight years
ago. Phillip sold them for $900 a pop, and the Vaudeville guy&#151;he comes from
family money&#151;bought them for $30,000 each.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Phillip&#8217;s the
owner of your gallery?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Ben. &#147;Rocco used to be at Mud23, but he got poached by this big gallery in New York
a few years ago. Phillip&#8217;s still good friends with him though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;With Rocco
Morris?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin asked Ben for
updates on some of their mutual friends from college, but Ben couldn&#8217;t tell her
anything that she didn&#8217;t already know: Nazneen, Marin&#8217;s freshman-year roommate
and Ben&#8217;s freshman-year girlfriend, had finished her co-term in management
science and was working at a management consulting firm in San Francisco;
Jorge, Ben&#8217;s best friend and former roommate/drawmate, was going to law school
at Berkeley; Max, Marin&#8217;s ex-boyfriend and one of Ben and Jorge&#8217;s former
drawmates, was a project manager in the City of Oakland&#8217;s housing department;
and Becky, Marin&#8217;s former drawmate, had just quit her cushy marketing job to
enroll in culinary school in upstate New York.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Actually there is
some gossip that you probably haven&#8217;t heard,&#148; said Ben. &#147;You&#8217;re the first
non-relative that I&#8217;m telling this to. Even Jorge doesn&#8217;t know yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Gossip about <i>you</i>?&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Isn&#8217;t that an oxymoron?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed. </p>

<p class="Story">What he had wasn&#8217;t
exactly discretion. Ben had more than a few picaresque, self-parodying tales
up his sleeve&#151;and he knew exactly how to tell them. What he had was more like
disciplined ease. He was in control of himself without being controlling, and
that made other people defer instinctively to him. Everyone waited for Ben to
tell them about himself on his own schedule and terms, a system that had
resulted in few surprises until now. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It was getting too
ironic&#133;&#148; Ben said, &#147;my girlfriend is a healthcare reform advocate, and I don&#8217;t
have health insurance. So. I proposed to Judith. She said &#8216;yes.&#8217; We&#8217;re
engaged.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, shut up,&#148; said
Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">She felt like she
was in a botched comedy sketch: she was smiling too much and didn&#8217;t know what
to say next.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed again. &#147;It just happened&#133; Tuesday,&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Congratulations,&#148;
said Marin. &#147;Nazneen is going to kill you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know,&#148; he said,
rolling his eyes. &#147;I haven&#8217;t told her yet. Our parents know, and they&#146;ve told a few other relatives, but we haven&#8217;t
told anyone else yet. I know that it seems a little sudden, but we&#8217;ve really
thought a lot about this. We did this intensive month of therapy together in
November after we moved in together. We almost broke up. But at the end of it
all we were more in love than ever before. And a few weeks ago I just knew
what I wanted to do.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Propose,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Ben,
and in his best worst Italian accent: &#147;<i>Poppa ze quezchen!</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They laughed. After a sip of her wine and a few moments to process Ben&#8217;s news, Marin could
imagine him as a young married, early Sunday mornings starting the coffee pot
and checking the egg count in the fridge before hauling out recycling bags
bulging with empty wine bottles and olive jars, the detritus of another
successful Blakeman-Lam dinner party the night before. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Ben had
always been similar. Neither of them fell in love easily. Marin had re-read
very few books in her adult life: she considered it a waste to re-read a book,
even a really good one, instead of reading something new. Similarly, after
Nazneen and Ben had broken up at the end of freshman year, Nazneen had refused
to go see movies with him, even in a large group, because Ben&#8217;s measured
reactions to them drove her crazy. One terrifically awful movie he dubbed an
&#147;unsuccessful execution of a unique idea.&#148; Another film that had left Nazneen,
Marin, three of their other female friends, and Max spellbound and sobbing, a dry-eyed Ben had
complimented succinctly for its &#147;nice themes.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">His professors had
loved this about him: Ben&#8217;s attention to history and complete deficit of
creative pretension. They got so few like him in art history. Indeed, Ben&#8217;s
driving motivation was not an outsider&#8217;s bid for relevance&#151;it was an insider&#8217;s
desire for self-sufficiency. His parents were owner-managers of an inn in
Martha&#8217;s Vineyard that was quite famous in certain tony New England circles. Ben had grown up in a world of beautiful old things, and in this world there
was no one more self-sufficient than the person who could walk into a room full
of beautiful old things and instantly know their worth. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin knew of three pieces of
art that Ben had truly fallen for: <i>Guernica </i>(he&#8217;d seen it live at the
Museo Reina Soph&#237;a in Madrid when he was seventeen), Francis Bacon&#8217;s
1953 painting of a caged blue monkey <i>Study of a Baboon </i>(it was Ben&#8217;s
dream to own a Bacon someday), and Walker Evans&#8217; iconic FSA photograph of a
steel mill from the back of an oversized cross headstone in a hillside
cemetery, <i>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</i>. All three were mature, sophisticated
works, with more than a hint of the political about them, much like Judith. </p>

<p class="Story">Unfortunately, as
Marin had learned the hard way, the instincts of the practical person are not
the most reliable: maybe because they don&#8217;t get much practice. A year and a
half ago Marin had fallen in love too; not with a man&#151;with two men and their
beautiful idea of what the world should be. She had used her instincts, and
was, at best, deeply ambivalent about the results. </p>

<p class="Story">Which was why Marin
was taking her time with the money. She was going to be careful and give
herself time to go through a process. That&#8217;s why Ben had been the first person
that she had called when she had come back: process. </p>

<p class="Story">The appetizers
arrived: a trio of bison sliders topped with roquefort cheese and garlic butter
and a spicy pickled watermelon and pancetta salad. Humidity and heat.</p>

<p class="Story">As Marin spooned
some of the salad onto her plate, she saw a Filipino man in his forties
coming down the aisle toward her: her former boss, Ray Marcos.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin?&#148; Ray said. &#147;Marin Choo? Is that really you?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He had a date with
him, a woman with very short, curly blonde hair, at least ten years younger
than him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In the flesh,&#148;
said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How was Borneo?&#148;
asked Ray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It was
an incredible learning experience,&#148; Marin said, &#147;but I got a little homesick.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I saw some of your
friends on the news a few months ago,&#148; said Ray. &#147;I guess they don&#8217;t very much
need my help now.&#148; To his date, he explained: &#147;Marin used to work for me, but
then she quit to go work with the orangutans in Borneo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray&#8217;s date smiled
brightly, but without any spark of recognition.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Why is it always &#8216;<i>the</i>
orangutans?&#8217;&#148; Marin asked. &#147;We never say, my vet specializes in treating &#8216;the
dogs&#8217; and &#8216;the cats,&#8217; but it&#8217;s always, &#8216;so what did you do with <i>the</i>
orangutans?&#8217; or &#8216;are <i>the</i> orangutans okay now?&#8217;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray nodded, either
acknowledging her point or simply trying to appease the crazy ranting lady.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed. &#147;I
missed you, Marin,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are you doing
back in San Francisco?&#148; asked Ray. &#147;Are you back for good?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;For a few years,
at least,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where are you
working?&#148; asked Ray. &#147;Or are you back for school?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m looking for a
job,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thank jeebus for
that. Grad schools are run by dingbats and perverts,&#148; said Ray. &#147;Sorry,&#148; he
said to Ben. &#147;But I mean, it&#8217;s true.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I agree,&#148; said
Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, Marin Choo&#8217;s
back, and she&#8217;s looking for a job!&#148; Ray said. &#147;You should have called me. We
just hired a new regional associate for South Asia. But email me&#151;we might have
something else for you. I can&#8217;t guarantee that it&#8217;ll be as interesting as what
you were doing in Borneo, but you&#8217;ll get to see <i>this</i> ugly old face
sometimes, and Jen Olyphant is still there, the whole motley crew&#133; Shoot me an
email. What did you guys get, the sliders? Those are <i>amazing</i>. The
watermelon salad&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not really a watermelon guy. Okay, welcome back,
Marin. Nice meeting you, Marin&#8217;s friend.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Ray and his date
left for their table, at the back of the room with two other couples.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow,&#148; said Ben. &#147;I always thought that you were exaggerating about him, but he really is just
the way that you described.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know if I
&#8216;described&#8217; so much as ranted,&#148; said Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you going to
email him?&#148; asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He does know everyone&#133;&#148;
said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you think that
he would help you find a job somewhere besides Pac?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Probably not,&#148;
said Marin. &#147;Ray Marcos! That was so surreal. I honestly thought that I
would never see that man again. But I should have known. He&#8217;s like the mob&#151;the
only way to escape him is a bullet in the back of your head.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s kind of right
about the salad,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, well,&#148; Marin
said, starting to feel a creepy ambivalence about their entire dinner now that
was all too familiar to her. &#147;So how are <i>your</i> boss people?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Things at the
magazine are fine,&#148; Ben said. &#147;And I have a good relationship with Phillip. He really knows what he&#8217;s doing. He started Mud23 in an unheated Alabama
Street storefront fourteen years ago when he was a twenty-year-old college
dropout, and he&#8217;s one of the best-known dealers in San Francisco now. I learn
a lot from just being in the same room with him every week, even though most of
my actual work sucks. It&#8217;s just mindless paperwork and grunt work&#133; To move up
though&#151;it doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;ve worked there two years or twenty&#151;I have to
bring a major new artist to the gallery.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How do you go
about doing that?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Either find an
established artist who&#8217;s unhappy with their current dealer and convince them to
come to us,&#148; Ben said, &#147;or take a talented unknown and turn them into the next
Damien Hirst.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How do you turn a
talented unknown into a famous hack?&#148; said Marin. &#147;Just kidding. I like
Damien.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sorry, it&#8217;s my
fault. I was being glib,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I&#8217;m sure Phillip would be more than happy
with the next Rocco Morris.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What if you
brought a new collector in?&#148; asked Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It depends on how
much and what they buy,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How about a new
collector ready to spend $200,000 on the next Rocco Morris?&#148; said Marin. &#147;Would that help?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben&#8217;s eyes
narrowed, and the envy that Marin saw flap quickly over his face mortified her
with its hunger. Money had that kind of power over them now. They had thought
that it never would, but it already did.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin,&#148; Ben said. &#147;How the heck did you get $200,000?&#148;</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2002</h2>
<h3>Will</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">M</span>aybe Will could
just watch. Pretend that he was back in Borneo, following Captain Kirk or one
of his other favorite wild orangutans: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p style="text-indent:0.25in;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:9pt"><i>Despite no hopes of
reproduction resulting from such a consort, <b>Human Male A (HM-A)</b>&#151;a tall,
carefully-tanned specimen with a thick, healthy crown of dark brown
hair&#151;approaches <b>Human Male B (HM-B)</b>&#151;young, blue-eyed, built like a
featherweight boxer. HM-A smiles, compliments HM-B on his Pet Shop Boys
T-shirt, asks if he was at their concert at Music Venue X in May. </i></p>

<p style="text-indent:0.25in;margin:0"><i>What&#8217;s this? <b>Human
Male C (HM-C)</b>&#151;1.8 metres tall, 80 kilos, unsure of his outfit, an
unattractive expression of grim determination on his face&#151;consumes a single
glass of fermented agave and lime juice. After zero attempts at social
contact, HM-C wanders away on his own, returning to his depressing
puke-green-colored chain hotel nest to fall asleep hours earlier than is
typical for a human male of his age.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">To
be fair, the hotel room was more of an olive than a puke. And Will was
jet-lagged, so he didn&#8217;t fall asleep right away when he got back to his room. He changed into the T-shirt and boxers that he&#8217;d brought to sleep in and pulled
the hotel comforter off the bed, folded it loosely, and tossed it
freethrow-style to the corner on the floor. He climbed into bed with a print
copy of his presentation and proceeded to stare at the opening slide for half
an hour:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>PALM OIL in BORNEO:</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Hidden Costs</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:24.0pt"><b>Irrevocable Consequences</b></p>

<p class="Story">Will would ordinarily
have been the last person to volunteer for a glad-handing expedition. However,
he had felt obligated to accompany Wan to San Francisco. Will knew these
international development types. He knew how to appeal to their sense of
righteousness in a roundabout way, how to get the wheels of change in motion,
all the while letting them think that it was their idea in the first place. You had to flatter these people&#8217;s sense of virtue and sidestep guilt&#151;both as a
philosophical concept and a fact-based judgment. </p>

<p class="Story">Wan had already
made the case in Malaysia at the local and national levels against the clearing
of 20,000 hectares (the equivalent of 40,000 football fields) of primary growth
forest at the edge of their research area for the cultivation of oil palm. Will and Wan had had eight meetings with forestry, agriculture, finance, and
international trade officials in Kuching, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya. </p>

<p class="Story">The Malaysian
officials were actually sympathetic to their position. Will and the others at
the O/URC didn&#8217;t really give them enough credit&#151;it was easy to underestimate
the (albeit self-serving) impetus towards patriotic emotion for a mid-level
bureaucrat. Most Malaysians were all too aware of their awkward cultural
presence on the world stage, especially since 9/11. Their prime minister was
an uninspiring, effective, openly anti-Semitic executive of an
above-average-performing but far from powerhouse Asian mixed economy. The
country&#8217;s rainforests offered a much more beatific vision of Malaysia: a Lewis-Carroll-worthy
wonderland of curious pitcher-shaped plants; long-nosed proboscis monkeys;
gigantic, stinky rafflesia flowers; and regal red-haired apes that floated
their one-hundred-kilogram bodies effortlessly through the trees. The
government officials that Wan and Will had spoken to were just as protective of
this Malaysia as the O/URC was. However, they were stuck. </p>

<p class="Story">The 20,000 hectares
in question were the subject of a five-year dispute with an Indonesian palm oil
firm. The Indonesian government had issued the palm oil firm concessions for
the land in 1997. All but ten hectares of the land had subsequently been found
to fall on the Malaysian side of the border (where it was considered part of
the national reserve); however, the palm oil firm (a subsidiary of ICT
Industries, a major corporate donor to some prominent national politicians in
both countries) had refused to give up its claim on the land. And then, just a
few months ago, a three-way agreement had been brokered: Malaysia&#8217;s forestry ministry
had agreed to let the firm develop the land, the firm had agreed to pay a fine
of 100,000 ringgit (about $25,000) and develop the land in keeping with the
highest existing international labor and environmental standards, and the
Indonesian government had agreed to aggressive new security measures targeting
cross-border timber smuggling from Kalimantan into Malaysian Borneo. </p>

<p class="Story">Wan had explained
to Will that things never worked out so neatly in this part of the world unless
it was the will of entrenched and powerful forces, the kind of forces that
weren&#8217;t accountable to anyone&#151;not even, in some cases, rational thought.</p>

<p class="Story">Then came that
off-hand remark by a finance official at the end of another dead-end meeting in
K.L.:</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Who knows, maybe
nothing will even happen,&#148; the official had said, &#147;everyone knows ICT
Industries is taking years on their contracts. Maybe this time all this crony
capitalism will work in our favor, for once.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Wan
later confirmed it with his contacts at a competitor company. ICT Industries
relied heavily on a steady stream of lucrative development contracts with the
World Bank and the Pac Development Bank. Therefore, a kind of sovereignty for
the O/URC&#8217;s situation lay with two multinational lenders headquartered in the
U.S.</p>

<p class="first">Will had proven his
use several times over on this trip already. Even though he had never been to
San Francisco before, he&#8217;d figured out the local public transit system in no
time. For dinner, Will had immediately zeroed in on Tadich Grill, the oldest continuously running restaurant in San Francisco. Its platinum-grade historical credentials were improbably matched by its charming ambience and the quality of its food. They&#146;d eaten at the bar, and Will had made friends with the woman sitting next to them. It had turned out that her cousin was a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, and she had given them the cousin&#8217;s phone number.</p>

<p class="Story">High on these most
preliminary of successes, Will had fished the tightest of his T-shirts (which,
luckily, was also one of the few unruined by the harsh local detergents he used
back east) out of the bottom of his suitcase and snuck off to the Castro
district for a drink after dinner. Disembarking the street car at Castro and Market, Will had followed a pair of hot guys holding
hands into a bar. The bar had been clean and bright, and there&#8217;d been a
good-sized crowd for nine o&#8217;clock at night. However, Will hadn&#8217;t known any of
the music playing, and for the entire twenty minutes that he&#8217;d been there he&#8217;d
kept thinking that he saw Wan walk in the door. If anyone had taken
enough interest in or pity on him to talk to him, Will had been so nervous and
self-conscious that he probably would have sabotaged the conversation and run away.</p>

<p class="last">This
fantastic performance was the closest that Will had gotten to having sex in
ten months. No, actually, it had been eleven months. He&#8217;d been living in a
Muslim country where having sex with another man was a criminal act punishable
by caning and up to twenty years in prison for the past nine of that eleven. (The hidden costs and irrevocable consequences of falling in love with a certain
rubber-cheeked redhead in an evolutionary biology elective at McGill University
nine years ago.)</p>

<p class="first">The next morning,
Will found Wan in front of the hotel restaurant scowling at the menu that was
mounted inside a glass-topped lectern by a potted plant with long fronds.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think there&#8217;s a
buffet,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Will there be
fruit, do you think?&#148; asked Wan.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Oh, that is the
question, </i>Will
thought, <i>that is really the question. </i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s my one vice,
you know,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will liked Wan&#151;he
was a charismatic leader of their little jungle outpost, thoughtful but
decisive, and inordinately worldly for a fisherman&#8217;s son from Mersing. However, as with his other coworkers at the O/URC, Will was never sure when he
crossed the line with Wan vis-&#224;-vis sensitive subjects like race, religion,
gender, and of course sexual orientation. Just how worldly was Dr. Wan
Mohammed, and how open-minded would he be about a certain mildly tart Canadian
fruit that had been imported to the O/URC nine months ago? </p>

<p class="Story">Will led the way to
the buffet area and took a heated plate from the spring-loaded dispenser. The
plate was still slightly wet with warm wash water. The centerpiece of the
buffet was heated round metal tureens covered by dome lids that swung open on a
hinge. The first tureen was a pie-sized mass of scrambled eggs. Will picked
up the large spoon at the foot of the
tureen, scooped out some spongey yellow egg onto his plate, and handed the
spoon to Wan, who was right behind him. Wan took the spoon, looked at the open
tureen full of egg, and closed the lid quietly, putting the spoon back on its
resting plate.</p>

<p class="Story">Tureen number two:
pork sausage links, smelling deliciously of maple syrup and fennel. Oh, how
Will had missed the smell of caramelized pork fat in the morning. He was
hungry and wanted four of the small links, but, not wanting to seem obscene,
took only one, closed the tureen lid, and put the serving tongs back on the
resting plate himself.</p>

<p class="Story">Tureen number three
was bacon, of course. Americans did love their animal protein, didn&#8217;t they? Then came biscuits and gravy, and home fries. Will took two strips of bacon
inextricably tangled together like the intertwined legs of the damned, and two
biscuits which he slathered with white gravy. Wan took a biscuit and home
fries and made a beeline for the fresh fruit at the salad bar.</p>

<p class="Story">Will went the
opposite direction to the made-to-order crepe station. A cute young
black woman, her shoulder-length hair tied back in a tight scouring pad of a ponytail, was slicing bananas at the back counter. Six tiny pans sat on six tiny
burners surrounded by bowls of sliced strawberries, sliced bananas, orange
marmalade, slivered almonds, chopped walnuts, chocolate sauce, and powdered
sugar. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, could I get a
plain banana crepe?&#148; Will asked the woman.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Keith should be
back any minute now,&#148; the woman said. &#147;He makes the crepes.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will should have
known better. He did know better, but before he could summon up the will to
act on what he knew, a young man with strawberry blond hair in a gray chef&#8217;s
coat appeared at the edge of the buffet area, stopping to horse around with the
Hispanic guy restocking the home fries tureen with fresh potatoes from a metal
roasting pan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey Keith!&#148; the
woman called out. &#147;You got a customer!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Alright, alright
Lizzie, geez,&#148; Keith said, coming over to the crepe station. &#147;You&#8217;re such a
micromanager.&#148;</p>
<p class="Story">Lizzie rolled her eyes, sliced quickly through the white fruit.</p>

<p class="Story">Keith put on a fresh pair of latex gloves, picked up a large Pyrex
measuring cup filled with batter, and gave it a good stir.</p>
<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, what can I get for you today?&#148; Keith said to Will, giving him a big smile of perfect, white American teeth. </p>

<p class="Story">Will looked over at Wan, who was opening an english muffin and putting it face-down on the slow-winding grill of a toaster oven a few yards away.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just a plain
banana crepe,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Plain?&#148; said
Keith, popping on the gas in one of the burners. Fingers of blue flame tickled
the bottom of the small pan on top. &#147;Maybe a tiny bit of powdered sugar on
top?&#148; he asked, again with the big smile.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He just wants the
banana crepe&#151;he don&#8217;t need it to be pretty,&#148; said Lizzie.</p>

<p class="Story">Lizzie&#8217;s objection
made Will certain that Keith was flirting with him. Oftentimes, straight girls
picked up on these things without even realizing it. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sure,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Keith was already
pouring a circle of milk-white batter into the heated pan. It caked up
quickly, and Keith scooped and flipped the crepe skin with a spatula.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan appeared out of
nowhere and said, &#147;What are you getting, banana pancake?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Keith&#8217;s fingers
nimbly arranged banana full moons in the center of the crepe skin. The back of
his right hand was covered in pale brown freckles. Will caught the chef&#8217;s eye
briefly, and for the first time Keith seemed uncertain of himself. Or, more
likely, uncertain of Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In Thailand they
make this with the condensed milk,&#148; Wan continued. &#147;Sometimes you find it in
Malaysia too. The tourists like it.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Keith was turning
around the crepe in the pan, folding the skin around the banana filling with
the edge of his spatula. He scooped up the finished roll, shimmied it onto a
small plate, and placed the plate on the glass counter in front of Will,
forgetting, Will noted painfully, the powdered sugar.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks,&#148; Will
said. &#147;This is exactly what I wanted.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Keith nodded
politely and started cleaning up his workstation. </p>

<p class="Story">Will felt cheated. Was Keith&#8217;s newfound dispassion disappointment at seeing (mistakenly, as it
were) that Will was &#147;with&#148; someone? That Will was &#147;with&#148; someone like Wan? Or
had Keith guessed at the truth?&#151;that Will, at thirty, was still closeted (not
to all people, just some! Will was out to all of Canada!)&#151;and the cook&#8217;s
sudden coldness had been pity and disdain.</p>

<p class="Story">Will took his crepe
plate and walked out to the dining room with Wan to find a table. Waiters in
white aprons poured fresh coffee and orange juice out of white plastic pitchers
into giganto white mugs and thick-bottomed glass tumblers for families and
businessmen. Hotel silverware tinkled against hotel china. Even the white
sunshine that filled the room seemed to have a preciously cultivated hotel glow
about it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is this okay?&#148; Wan had chosen a small table for two with two big armchairs.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sure,&#148; said Will. He put his plates down at his setting, his stomach grumbling. He was just
hungry, that was it. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your pancake looks
good, man,&#148; Wan said, sitting down. &#147;But do you think that guy making the
pancakes was&#133; you know?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will had a
blistering hatred for fascist euphemisms for homosexuality. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I mean, I don&#8217;t
really know anything about anything like that,&#148; Wan continued. &#147;He just seemed
different from you somehow.&#148; Strikes two and three.</p>

<p class="Story">Now was Will&#8217;s
chance. He knew that Wan respected him, as a scientist, employee, and friend. It was two words. Well, one contraction and one word. All that he had to do
was say them.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah,&#148; Will said. &#147;Maybe.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">He
couldn&#8217;t do it. He couldn&#8217;t be the O/URC&#8217;s first gay. He was already their
only white person, which was an incredibly exhausting job in and of itself, if also an
enlightening one in some ways.</p>

<p class="first">The Pac Development Bank&#8217;s reception area was as big as the largest branch of Will&#8217;s bank in Kuching. The furniture, floors,
and walls were all colored the same expensive-looking shade of charcoal
briquette gray. The path from the elevator bank to the reception desk was
flanked with two long granite museum-style exhibit walls displaying plastic models
and framed photographs of hydroelectric dams, school and hospital buildings,
and bridges, and backlit blueprints for electricity grids and other projects. Two
receptionists, a young white man with long hair pulled back into a ponytail and an Asian woman with a Spock haircut, sat behind a narrow desk speaking softly into the pill-shaped microphones of their headpieces. Silver-plated letters spelling out <i>&#147;Pac Development Bank&#148;</i> were mounted on the gray wall behind them, along with the Pac logo, a crescent with a serrated outer edge. </p>

<p class="Story">The male
receptionist wrapped up his call and pulled the microphone up and away from his
mouth. It stuck out straight from the side of his jaw in the pulled-out
position, a bug leg in rigor mortis.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Selamat datang</i>
Pac Development Bank,&#148; he said to Will and Wan, in a voice ordered to match the
charcoal gray of the room. </p>

<p class="Story">Wan asked the man
if he spoke Bahasa Malaysia.</p>

<p class="Story">He replied in very
fine Bahasa, <i>&#147;a little bit of Bahasa Indonesia, but I&#8217;m still working on
it. You are Dr. Mohammed?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, yes,&#148; said
Wan. &#147;Dr. Wan Mohammed and Dr. Will St. James.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Our regional
director for Southeast Asia, Ray Marcos, will be meeting with you today,&#148; the
man said in English. &#147;I have let Mr. Marcos know that you have arrived. Please have a seat to your left. He will be with you shortly.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">He motioned to a
waiting area around and behind the exhibit wall on their left. Will and Wan
walked to the waiting area and sat down in low-seating gray leather armchairs. Will stared hard at the gray bowl of gray plastic fruit on the small gray table
between them. Behind him he could hear the receptionists answer a steady
stream of phone calls in Korean, French, Mandarin, English, all in the same
dulcet, inviolable tone. On the wall behind Wan was a series of gray abstract
paintings: each cool, firm, textured stroke glorifying some apocryphal
sameness.</p>

<p class="Story">Waiting rooms were still the liminal petri dishes of the powerful that they had been for Will ever since he was little, wreaking mild havoc with his sister on their father&#8217;s gastroenterology practice. The one place in Dr. St. James&#146;s office to which the St. James children had never dared venture was the waiting room. They were not shy children, but their father&#8217;s patients terrified them. They could sense the unholy mix of scatology,
science, and servicing that had brought the six to ten Montrealeans outside to
the blue-carpeted waiting room on a given day.</p>

<p class="Story">One of the doors
behind Wan opened, and a man emerged. He was tan and
heavyset, but not fat. His large brown eyes recessed back into a face densely
populated with tiny riddles and stresses. He was dressed with the sartorial
flair (or was it nonchalance?) of a movie producer: pressed olive-oil-brown
slacks, white button-down oxford with the sleeves rolled up, and sockless feet
in Italian leather loafers. </p>

<p class="Story">Will and Wan stood,
and the man approached them.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Dr. Mohammed?&#148; he
asked, reaching out his hand to Wan. Wan shook
it. &#147;Nice to meet you,&#148; said the man. &#147;I&#8217;m Ray Marcos.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nice to meet you,&#148;
said Wan. &#147;This is Dr. St. James, a primatologist working with us in Sarawak.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray and Will shook
hands.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Great to meet
you,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very nice to meet
you too,&#148; said Ray. &#147;We&#8217;re going to be in Meeting Room C-1 today,&#148; he said,
crossing in front of reception to the other side of the room. He opened a gray
door and led them down a short hallway to a large conference room where a tall,
bird-framed blonde about Will&#8217;s age (thirty) and a younger Asian woman with
shoulder-length hair were sitting at the far end of a long wood conference
table inlaid with a runner of espresso-colored leather. Although of average
height and weight, there was something Amazonian, something of a cud-chewing
woodland creature about the latter. She was wearing a sleeveless black knit
dress that revealed a black crow-shaped tattoo on her right upper arm.</p>

<p class="Story">Will had memorized
all three of their bios from the Pac website. Ray Marcos, regional director
for Southeast Asia, was a Filipino-American from Queens, New York. He had
studied political science and economics at Columbia University and then worked
as a commodities trader on Wall Street for three years. After getting his
M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, Marcos had worked at Pac&#8217;s Asian
headquarters in Bangkok for fifteen years until his transfer to Pac&#8217;s global
headquarters in San Francisco four years ago. He spoke Tagalog, Thai, French,
and Japanese.</p>

<p class="Story">The blonde was
Jennifer Olyphant. A Pasadena native, Olyphant had studied sociology at Vassar
and received her J.D. from Berkeley in 1997. Prior to joining Pac as a
regional associate, she had worked for three years as a bankruptcy lawyer in
Tokyo. She was fluent in Japanese and conversant in Korean.</p>

<p class="Story">The punk ing&#233;nue
was Marin Choo. Born and raised in Naperville, Illinois, Choo had very recently
graduated from Stanford, Phi Beta Kappa in international relations. She had
also won the prestigious Soames Fellowship in Public Service, which was funding
her work as a regional specialist at Pac for one year. She was fluent in
Tagalog, Amoy, and Cantonese and conversant in Mandarin.</p>

<p class="Story">Ray introduced them
as Jen and Marin. </p>

<p class="Story" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">Wan took out Will&#8217;s
laptop, connected it to the projector set up on the table, and pulled up Will&#8217;s
presentation. The first slide appeared on the white screen at the head of the room:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>PALM OIL in BORNEO:</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Hidden Costs</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:24.0pt"><b>Irrevocable Consequences</b></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;First off,&#148; Will
said, &#147;I just wanted to say that both Dr. Mohammed and I have so much respect
for everything that Pac does to alleviate poverty and build infrastructure in
developing countries around the world. The O/URC is also extremely indebted to the
indigenous communities of Sarawak, whose relationship with the jungle goes back
more than six hundred years. That being said, there are some things that
cannot be ignored.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;As you probably know, the oil palm tree, <i>Arecaceae Elaeis
guineenis</i>,<i> </i>is not native to Borneo. However, cleared rainforest
land in Borneo has shown suitable for few other agricultural products in high
demand in the global economy. In a very short amount of time, the edible
vegetable oil derived from the fruit of the <i>Arecaceae Elaeis guineenis</i>
has become one of Malaysia&#8217;s and Indonesia&#8217;s biggest export products, and
currently these two countries account for 84% of palm oil production
worldwide. Palm oil accounts for 23% of world production and 51% of global
trade in edible oils, filling the surging demand from multinational
corporations like Unilever, Cargill, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Nestl&#233;, and Kraft
for non-hydrogenated solid vegetable oils. Do me a favor. When you get home
tonight, turn over the bag of chips and box of crackers that you have in your
pantry. If you use bar soap, look at the packaging. Even if you only buy
all-natural, organic, low-fat, multigrain, free trade&#133; if you&#8217;re not Amish,
chances are that you have a number of palm oil products in your home.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">The Marin girl
scribbled something down in her notebook. Jen Olyphant looked longingly out
the window at the sun-drenched bay. Ray Marcos was looking right at Will,
listening intently, and seemed&#133; amused.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oil palm was
responsible for 86% of all deforestation in Malaysia from 1995 to 2000,&#148; Will
continued. &#147;Forest clearing for oil palm results in the loss of 80% of area
plant species and over 80% of local mammal, reptile, and bird populations. Deforestation has been shown to eliminate or endanger a wealth of evolutionary
data&#151;it&#8217;s quite possible that oil palm has already wiped out that one
undiscovered exotic plant that secreted that one enzyme that had the ability to
reverse cancer-like cell growth. With hundreds of thousands of hectares of
primary growth rainforest being practically given away to oil palm firms by the
Malaysian and Indonesian governments every year, such hidden costs are not
built into the current economics of oil palm: thus the astounding 26% annual
internal rate of returns for some oil palm firms in Indonesian Borneo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then there are
the orangutans.&#148; Will paused. This had been the most difficult portion of his
presentation to write. The temptation was to cast the orangutans as the
adorable innocents requiring protection from the ubiquitous evil of human
industry. However, not only was this a terrible clich&#233;, it was also not true. The orangutans were what they were. They could be wise, ferocious, obnoxious,
and, yes, adorable, depending on their personality, mood, and the situation at
hand. &#147;I have news for you about the orangutans that might surprise you,&#148; Will
said. &#147;They don&#8217;t need us. We need them.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will clicked to the
next slide: Daisy the orangutan, biting into a termite nest like it was a
chocolate fudge brownie fresh out of the oven. Next: Kitana, an exhausted new
mother, breastfeeding the collection of amber fuzz, black wrinkles, and big
brown eyes that was her newborn baby, Kay. Next: Thierry, a wild sub-adult
male, hanging sideways in the forest canopy, his long black hands and feet
wrapping around the hardy dipterocarp trunks that were so attractive to local
loggers.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sharing 97% of our
DNA, orangutans are some of our closest living relatives,&#148; Will continued. &#147;Orangutans are us without the bullshit. They have emotions without drama. Memory without history. Behavior without psychiatry. With all of modern <i>Homo
sapiens&#8217;</i> technology, medicine, twenty-four-hour satellite TV, and
psychotropic drugs on demand, we can&#8217;t seem to quite figure out how to be happy
and healthy, how to live peacefully and sustainably. The truth is that even
with universities and libraries full of knowledge, we remain mysteries to
ourselves.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">This was not a line
of argument that Wan had used at any of their meetings in Malaysia, and Will
looked at him to see if there was any hint of disapproval. On the contrary,
Wan was nodding his head in approbation.</p>

<p class="Story">Will continued:
&#147;The study of great apes such as orangutans affords us a unique opportunity to
unpack the mysteries of human nature from human civilization and
self-consciousness. And one does not study orangutans for very long before one
realizes that the study of orangutans makes no sense outside the context of
their natural habitat. As orangutans are highly nomadic creatures, traversing
many miles of rainforest in a year, the continued study of orangutans is
dependent on the preservation of very large areas of primary growth rainforest,
complex ecosystems that Malaysian and Indonesian oil palm firms burn down to
clear and repopulate with a single species: <i>Arecaceae Elaeis guineenis</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will pulled up the
next slide: a map of Borneo. Their research area was highlighted in blue and
the 20,000 hectares in danger in orange. Will explained the devastating direct
and ripple effects that losing this parcel of land to an oil palm plantation
would have on wild orangutans throughout Borneo. Will then explained the
historical confusion regarding the ownership of the land; referred to a written
statement from Malaysia&#8217;s Minister of Forestry confirming Malaysia&#8217;s commitment
to protect the 20,000 hectares should &#147;all other claims and concessions&#148; to the
land be renounced; and briefly referenced the corporate relationship between
the oil palm firm and ICT Industries, ICT&#8217;s political connections, and ICT&#8217;s
access to valuable development contracts with Pac and the World Bank. Will let
go unstated the understanding that ICT Industries&#8217; contracted services may have
been less than satisfactorily completed. &#147;Pac has given over $1 billion in
loans to projects in Malaysia and Indonesia combined over the past ten years,&#148;
Will said. &#147;We need your help to make certain that ICT Industries&#8217; subsidiary
relinquishes its fictional claim on this land.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Wan clicked out of
the presentation, pulling up a full-screen image of part of the O/URC campus, a
cleared-out portion of the jungle with a single paved road that curved around
the center of the clearing and then left the way it came. Amiable, nondescript
bungalows dotted the landscape, not with a complete absence of charm.</p>

<p class="Story">Ray spoke first. &#147;What does the &#8216;R&#8217; stand for again?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Excuse me?&#148; said
Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In O/URC. Rehabilitation or research? What does the &#8216;R&#8217; stand for?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The full name of
the organization is the Orang-Utan Rehabilitation Center,&#148; said Wan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve heard about
this rehabilitation,&#148; Ray said. &#147;Have you heard about this Marin? What they
do is they recover the monkeys that people have been keeping as pets. Really,
really disturbed and damaged animals. They confiscate them from their
&#8216;owners,&#8217; and then they try to retrain them for life in the wild. A few of
them turn out okay, but the vast majority are too damaged. Even worse, they
spread diseases from their human rehabilitators to wild orangutans, the very
beings that everyone is trying to protect and study in the first place.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We do not have
ex-captives on the main grounds except under very controlled conditions now,&#148;
said Wan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, the O/URC
follows a very strict program of quarantine, vaccination, peer rehabilitation,
and release of ex-captives,&#148; said Will. &#147;The kind of rehabilitation you&#8217;re
thinking of is no longer standard practice.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, but you see,
my issue is that you come here under the pretense of scientists, throwing
around the Latin. And yet, you do not even mention the rehabilitation portion
of your organization&#8217;s mission in your presentation. ICT Industries is a local
company. Where does the O/URC get its funding? Pac is 87% funded by its
Pacific-Rim member countries, by the way.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We have WWF
funding,&#148; said Wan. &#147;We also received two foreign research grants this
year&#151;from Netherlands and the U.K.&#151;but the Malaysia government provided seed
money to build the original camp, to make renovations last year, and always is
supplementing where it can. Dr. St. James is the only expatriate on staff. We
also have a Singaporean botanist, but everyone else on staff is Malaysian.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think that it&#8217;s
tempting,&#148; Marin said, &#147;to draw parallels between &#8216;imperialism&#8217; and the work
that <i>all</i> of us do when Western developed nations and Eastern developing
nations are involved.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not drawing
parallels,&#148; said Ray. &#147;I believe that our guests believe that what they want
for this piece of land is better than what ICT Industries wants for this piece
of land. I am just skeptical that this is true. Do you know how poor the
country of Indonesia is, Dr. Mohammed? Gross national income per person in
2000 was $600. The same figure for South Korea, which was also hit hard by the
financial crisis and received IMF aid, was $5,900. For the U.S. it was
$34,000. We can afford to protect status quo in this country. In Southeast
Asia, well&#133; Dr. St. James himself has just illustrated very clearly how vital
oil palm revenues have been to growth in the Malaysia and Indonesia economies
in the past decade.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe oil palm
makes the neat little numbers in your reports go up, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that
it&#8217;s actually making life better for all but a handful of people in Borneo,&#148;
said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;ICT Industries&#8217;
motivations are self-serving,&#148; Ray said. &#147;I do not doubt that much. However,
the development of a major new agribusiness sector in a country where the
annual GNI per person is the equivalent of my cable bill for the year is
something more than status quo. Dr. St. James, I&#8217;m surprised that <i>you</i>,
of all people, are here today as such a fierce proponent of status quo, considering&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">There was only one
thing that Ray Marcos could have meant by that, and yet Will was strangely
calm. He silently dared Ray Marcos to out him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Considering what?&#148;
asked Wan. &#147;Sometimes it takes the most vision to see what&#8217;s worth protecting,
what&#8217;s worth keeping.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray looked back and
forth between Will and Wan with the same amused expression that he&#8217;d had during
Will&#8217;s presentation. &#147;You&#8217;re quite right, Dr. Mohammed,&#148; he said. &#147;However, <i>withholding
aid </i>to a country (which I believe is what you&#8217;re asking us to do) is not
only a strict violation of Bank policy, but would be dangerous politicking not
to mention incredibly hypocritical, considering that developing a plantation
for an agricultural export in high demand is the very kind of thing we regularly
lend money to our borrower countries to accomplish. It&#8217;s been very interesting
meeting you both. I&#8217;m sorry but I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;ll be able to help you. Jen, can you see them out?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jen looked up at
Ray, then at Will and Wan, as if they&#8217;d all just asked her to join a marching
band. &#147;I&#8217;ve got a 3:45 call with Warren,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I thought you
talked to him this morning,&#148; said Ray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I was supposed
to,&#148; said Jen, &#147;but Dadinth didn&#8217;t finish rendering my charts until two
o&#8217;clock.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Who in Dadinth?&#148;
asked Ray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can see them
out,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You and I need to
talk about the Laos review,&#148; said Ray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know,&#148; said
Marin. &#147;We will.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray nodded, but
seemed unsatisfied. </p>

<p class="Story">To Will and Wan he
said, &#147;Don&#8217;t try stealing this one&#151;&#148; Ray indicated Marin with his thumb. &#147;&#151;away to Borneo. She&#8217;s an endangered species around these parts, you know.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He and Jen left,
arguing about &#147;Dadinth,&#148; whatever that was. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin stood up and
grimaced sheepishly. &#147;You&#8217;ll have to forgive Ray. He does a lot, but he comes
from a different generation so he&#8217;s not as open-minded about projects outside
of the mainstream of traditional development as he probably should be.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You don&#8217;t know
what you don&#8217;t know, I guess,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, he really
should know,&#148; said Marin. &#147;It&#8217;s our job to know.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin opened the
door and propped it open as Will and Wan packed their things.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sounds like you
have a pretty interesting job then,&#148; said Will. He meant this as another round
of wordplay, playing off her use of the word &#147;job,&#148; but Marin understood him
literally.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I got this
fellowship,&#148; she said. She had told this story many times already and was
tired of telling it, Will could tell. &#147;So I could have worked anywhere
really. I interviewed at eighteen organizations in New York, D.C., and San
Francisco. I chose Pac because I used several Pac projects as case studies for
my senior thesis, so I thought that I had a good sense of what they were about,
and also because they offered me this regional specialist position. A lot of
the other positions that I was offered were much more marginal.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Wan
shouldered their packed bags, and Marin led them back out, through the
reception area, through the double doors to the pearl deco elevator bank, which
was empty. Marin pressed the down button.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If you and Mr.
Marcos ever come to Borneo&#133;&#148; said Wan.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin grinned an
unexpectedly dimpled grin. &#147;You wouldn&#8217;t know it by the looks of him now,&#148; she
said, &#147;but Ray used to backpack all over Asia.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That doesn&#8217;t
surprise me, actually,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He was apparently
very hardcore,&#148; she said. &#147;He claims that he lived on an insect-only diet for
a month in Thailand in the eighties.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That explains a
lot,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">The three of them
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">The elevator on
their right dinged open, and Will and Wan walked inside.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, you must
have to travel in Asia sometimes for the Bank,&#148; Wan said. &#147;Come to Borneo:
what we do is not like anything else that you&#8217;ll ever see, really.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nice meeting you,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;We&#8217;ll see.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Wan pressed the &#147;G&#148;
button, and the elevator doors dinged closed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nice young woman,&#148;
said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Wan.
&#147;We could use someone like her, no?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will nodded,
feeling depressed. They had another twenty-four hours in San Francisco before
their flight to D.C. for what was sure to be a fluffy meet-and-greet with some
low-level World Bank staffers, and he didn&#8217;t think that he could bear any of it
in the wake of their utter failure at Pac. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I mean, someone
like her exactly,&#148; said Wan. He cracked the knuckles in his left hand.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t think that
<i>Ray Marcos</i> would be too happy with that idea,&#148; said Will. The name
already had the salty tinge of a thousand bitter-ironic/ironic-bitter
non sequiturs about it. &#147;He seems pretty attached to the girl.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Exactly,&#148; said
Wan.</p>

<p class="Story">What was Wan
proposing, a poaching expedition? Although oil palm was the primary bad guy in
the world of orangutan conservation these days, local poachers were still a
problem too. They hunted orangutan mothers: killed the mothers and kidnapped
the children to sell on exotic animal black markets for $1,000 a head. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do we have a job
to offer her?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We have plenty
jobs,&#148; said Wan. &#147;She has that fellowship, remember?&#148; He thought a moment. &#147;Anything
Consultant, <i>lah</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She&#8217;ll never go

before choosing this one, remember?&#148;</p>

dinged open, onto a young woman in glasses and a
young Asian woman, both carrying salads in plastic takeout boxes and looking

<p class="Story">Will laughed and
shook his head in a negative way, but he was realizing: it was the perfect
compromise. He could stay in Borneo and also<i> be out</i>, in a way, if Marin
came&#151;because he could be out <i>to her</i>. &#147;This is crazy,&#148; he said. &#147;We

<p class="Story">&#147;I found Linda in

wanted to &#8216;returning them to forest,&#8217; <i>lah</i>. This was Anwar. And you I spoke to on
the phone one time only before offering you the job. When Anwar and I get you that first time at Kuching Airport, every strange-looking white guy that came out the gate

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he air felt different down here.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Welcome to the
sixth floor,&#148; said Marin&#8217;s new boss, Adam Breesman, Pac&#8217;s Head of Data and Information Analysis, or DatInf, as everyone at Pac called
it. &#147;One half of it, at least,&#148; Adam said. </p>

<p class="Story">DatInf shared the
sixth floor with the office of Dr. Clyde Wilde, a cosmetic dentist. When Marin
had worked for Ray Marcos, whenever she and Ray had been in the elevator
together and someone else got off or on at the sixth floor, Ray would either
(if he thought the person was a Dr. Wilde patient) bare his teeth in the manner
of a child being forced to smile for a photo or (if he thought the person was
DatInf) frown in the manner of a child pouting.</p>

<p class="Story">Adam continued:
&#147;DatInf can be pretty different from other parts of Pac. We don&#8217;t do any
lending, obviously, no project development, no country reviews. Some people
might say that we&#8217;re just a bunch of data monkeys. But there&#8217;s actually some
awesome opportunities for growth here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">It wasn&#8217;t the air
that was different, Marin realized. It was the light. Adam&#8217;s office had a
large window, but, unlike the sunny perimeter offices on the tenth floor where
she used to work, the sixth floor appeared to be just in the shadow of a
neighboring building. </p>

<p class="Story">Someone was popping
popcorn in the kitchenette down the hall. Marin could hear the hot whirring of
the microwave and the staggered tapping of the puffing corn against the paper
bag; the urine-like smell of laboratory-generated butter-flavor filled the air.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So the databases
should pretty much work the same as when you were an RS,&#148; Adam said, &#147;and I&#8217;m
sure you came down once or twice for a data source file. You&#8217;ll get to know
the data source files really, really well down here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">DatInf maintained
Pac&#8217;s comprehensive electronic database of statistics: they helped Pac&#8217;s
research officers and project managers to input data from research and
development projects in the field in Asia, review the data for reliability and
validity, run complicated analyses on it, and otherwise prepare it for
publication. DatInf also filed and stored print (for post-1995 projects) and
microfiche (for pre-1995 projects) copies of original project results, records,
and other source materials in metal filing cabinets arranged throughout the
sixth floor in jaunty Tetris block formations. Marin knew that the files were
organized by region, by country, and by name of principal researcher (as well
as cross-coded on a number of indices in a master database), but there still
had always seemed something disturbingly Big Brother about coming across a
reference to an obscure 1996 Pac report about Sri Lankan rubber production,
calling downstairs for the data source files, and having a manila folder filled
with photocopies of the original handwritten ledgers and rubber plantation
photos show up on her desk two days later.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So do you want to
get oriented at your workstation?&#148; asked Adam.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In DatInf we
work in labs of four to six. You and your labmates are physically located in
the same room and are responsible for cross-checking each other&#8217;s work, as well
as covering for each other during absences and vacations.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Adam&#8217;s
phone started ringing, in extended treble warbles. &#147;Excuse me just one sec,&#148;
he said. &#147;I have to get this. It&#8217;s&#151;well, it&#8217;s Vipool, the new RS for
Southeast Asia. The new you.&#148; Adam picked up the phone. &#147;Hi Vipool. Did you
click on the link that I sent you?&#148; Adam listened. &#147;Okay, yes. Yes, okay, I
just misunderstood what you wanted before.&#148; Adam scribbled something down on a
small notepad on his desk. &#147;Okay, sure. Yes, I&#8217;ve got it now. Thanks,
Vipool.&#148; Adam hung up and turned back to Marin. &#147;He&#8217;s such a nice guy,&#148; he
said. </p>

<p class="first">Marin&#8217;s lab was set up like a computer
cluster at a library: six desks in two rows of three, pushed
together back-to-back. Computers sat on five of the desks and a large laser
printer sat on the sixth. Adam introduced Marin to the four data/information specialists
in her lab: Robert Nguyen, a pudgy young Vietnamese man; Kendra Lahey, a pretty
brunette in glasses who visibly winced when Adam asked them to &#147;make Marin feel
welcome;&#148; Joon Park, a moon-faced woman who got up and adjusted the
thermostat twice while Adam was talking; and Sergey Lennon, five feet and
four-and-a-half inches of smirking Bolshevik good looks. Robert, Kendra, and Joon were on one side of the
cluster, and Marin, Sergey, and the printer were on the other. </p>

<p class="Story">When Adam left,
Robert schlepped on a huge pair of black padded headphones, glared into his
computer monitor, and started typing. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Adam&#8217;s on fire
today,&#148; said Joon. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe he found a
Pac-logo-shaped Cheerio in his cereal again,&#148; said Kendra.</p>

<p class="Story">Joon snickered
quietly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That happened <i>once</i>,&#148;
said Sergey. &#147;Give the guy a break.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The very fact that
he is a single forty-year-old man who eats a kids&#8217; cereal for breakfast is
justification enough to mock him for the rest of his life,&#148; said Joon.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He brought the
Cheerio in,&#148; said Kendra, &#147;like, <i>to work</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It did look like
the Pac logo,&#148; said Sergey.</p>

<p class="Story">The printer made
choppy printing noises, and Sergey rolled in his chair one desk over to the
printer desk. With the back of his index finger, he flipped up the corner of
the printed sheet that had just steamed into the small valley on top. He
cleared his throat at a disproportionate volume to the amount of mucus that he
had in it. He drummed his fingers on the laminate surface of the desk as more
pages printed.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
logged into her personal webmail account. She had two unread emails: one from
her father titled &#147;product launch in SF in October&#148; and one from her college
friend Nazneen titled &#147;what the hell??&#148; She opened the one from her father
first:</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">The printer
quieted, and Sergey grabbed his printed pages with one claw, fully extended his
paper-holding arm above his head, yawned, rolled back to his own desk, and
violently dead-dropped the papers in a messy pile at the side of his computer
keyboard. </p>

<p class="last">Marin

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">And
I am so pissed at Ben, what the F is he thinking, getting F-ing married at his
age?</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">So
I finally went out with Rubik&#8217;s Cube Boy tonight. We went to Scott Bistro
(have you been? - RIDICULOUS ribs) and for drinks at Dill Bar after. We had a
great time - he told the most hilarious stories about his boss, who used to be
my boss until I finally figured out how to get transferred to my current team. (An achievement that RCB relayed his awe and envy of numerous times during the
date.) Etc., etc., he walked me home and then (drum roll please&#133;) NOTHING!! I
invited him up, but he said he has an &#147;early morning&#148; tomorrow at work. I
definitely like a guy who prioritizes work, but I know people on his team, and
I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re really that busy right now. I don&#8217;t understand if it was
a brush off - we were having such a good time!</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">I
hate guys. But he&#8217;s so hot and funny and he gets me and he&#8217;s HOT.</p>

new with you?</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">Naz</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">Without replying to
either email, Marin logged out.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s phone
rang. The small screen on her phone flashed &#147;UNAVAILABLE ID.&#148; She was
uncertain if she should answer it, but she picked up and said, &#147;Hello? DatInf,
this is Marin.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ray Marcos roared
with laughter on the other end of the line.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, I see how
it&#8217;s going to be,&#148; she said. The room had quieted, and Joon was looking at her
suspiciously.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Stick it out,
learn what you can, and we&#8217;ll have you back on a normal floor again soon, I
promise,&#148; said Ray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#148;
said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wouldn&#8217;t expect
anything less,&#148; said Ray. &#147;I&#8217;ve got to run. <i>Vipool, wait, I want to see
those.</i> Got to go. Bye, Marin.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye,&#148; she said and
hung up. She sensed three heads refocus on their computer screens, three sets
of hands burst into a newly committed flurry of typing.</p>

<p class="Story">Was DatInf beneath her? Everyone seemed to think so, including, it seemed, her new coworkers in DatInf.  However, the truth was that Marin had taken the job at Pac <i>because</i> it was in DatInf. She had no desire to be sucked back into Ray&#8217;s world, with its
intricate loyalties and castes, perpetual rites of passage, unpredictable
moments of benevolence, and all-consuming intensity.</p>

<p class="Story">There was a ripping
sound at the door: Adam, tearing open a padded express courier envelope. He
had another already-opened envelope tucked under his arm.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, okay, I have
your first assignments here, Marin,&#148; said Adam. &#147;Hot off the presses from&#151;&#148; he
looked at the address slips. &#147;Bangladesh and&#133; Chengdu, China.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Adam peeked in the
Chengdu envelope. &#147;Hm, that&#8217;s interesting,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">He pulled up the
other envelope to the front. &#147;So this one is a pretty straightforward survey
of poverty indicators in rural Bangladesh,&#148; said Adam. &#147;Everything should be
on these two CDs&#151;so the data just needs to be imported into PDB, assimilated,
and then elevated to analysis,&#148; Adam handed the Bangladesh envelope to Marin. &#147;But this one&#133;&#148; He pulled a stack of papers and a tattered spiral notebook
from the other envelope. &#147;This one was done old school for some reason. The
data was recorded by hand. I think the project manager left some instructions,
but looks like you&#8217;ll be entering everything in by hand. Both data sets should
be cross-checked of course using the cross-check sheet&#151;any of these guys can
help with that. And it might be a good idea to have an additional person
cross-check the Chengdu data set. If you have any questions just dial my
extension, alright?&#148; Adam rubbed his elbow. &#147;Is everyone else cool?&#148; he said
to the broader population of the room. &#147;If anyone has any questions, dial my
extension, alright?&#148; He left.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin pulled out
the two CDs from the Bangladesh envelope. The project manager had handwritten
directly onto the disks in black permanent marker: <i>&#147;Bangladesh Poverty 04
Disk #1&#148;</i> and <i>&#147;Bangladesh Poverty 04 Disk #2,&#148;</i> respectively. Marin
opened the case of Disk #1, opened the CD-ROM drive of her computer, inserted
the CD, pushed the drive back in, and waited while the computer made whooshing
and puttering loading noises.</p>

<p class="Story">It had been three
weeks since Marin&#8217;s dinner with Ben at Vaudeville, and she still had not heard
from him. That night at dinner, he hadn&#8217;t told her too much, only that, as a
first time buyer, it was important to buy pieces that complemented each other
and formed the basis for a coherent collection. With her budget, she could buy
a number of serious but smaller ticket works by some well-regarded contemporary
artists at an early stage in their careers. Ben had said that he&#8217;d research
upcoming market opportunities and get back to her with some ideas. </p>

<p class="Story">For the first day
or two after Marin had moved back to San Francisco, wherever she&#8217;d gone, she&#8217;d
reoriented herself to things in terms of whether or not she should and/or could
purchase them with her $200,000. She&#8217;d imaginary purchased an entire block of
street-parked cars (an unusual concentration of cute Volkswagens on Sanchez
Street one day), her corner coffee shop&#8217;s inventory for the year, twenty palm
trees, Charter Seat Licenses and season tickets for eight at PacBell Park,
two-hundred-thousand raw Tomales Bay oysters, and she didn&#8217;t know the exact
numbers, but she thought that she could afford at least a 20% stake in her
favorite independent moviehouse in the city.</p>

<p class="Story">The art-buying
idea, Marin admitted, seemed no less indulgent than these fantasies, but she
saw it as a purely practical decision, based on the expertise available to her
in her immediate social circle. If, instead of Ben, she&#8217;d had close, trusted
friends working at hedge funds or in real estate, then she would have taken
them out to dinner to pick their brains about hot stocks or condos. Besides, she had already promised herself that she wouldn&#8217;t buy
anything unless there was evidence from multiple sources of its long-term investment
value. She didn&#8217;t want, and planned to resist the urge, to fall in love.</p>

<p class="Story">The computer
quieted and a window popped up on Marin&#8217;s monitor: <i>&#147;You have entered a disk
into drive E:\,&#148;</i> said the window. <i>&#147;What would you like to do with the
disk?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin selected the <i>&#147;Open
as a Folder&#148;</i> option and clicked &#147;Continue.&#148; There were four files on the
disk: two spreadsheets, BANG_04-Whitman_Stats.xls and
BANG_04-Whitman_Stats-2.xls, and two word processing documents,
BANG_04-Whitman_Summary.doc and BANG_04-Whitman_Full_Report_Text.doc. She
opened BANG_04-Whitman_Stats.xls and her computer screen filled with gloomy
data. </p>

<p class="Story">Some manual
adjustments would have to be made before importing the spreadsheet data into
Pac&#8217;s networked database, PDB. PDB did not accept formulas, for example, and
the spreadsheet still had plenty built in. PDB also did not like
non-terminating decimals, blank cells in arrays, and certain symbols, even in
the label text ($,-,/,&amp;,%,#,[,],?,!, and : being a non-exhaustive list.) Even decimal points were not de rigueur if not flanked on both ends by a
numeric digit.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin spent the
next hour making the necessary adjustments and saved her work as a new
document: BANG_04-Whitman_Stats_MCedits.xls. She opened PDB and imported her
file. She opened the imported file as a table in PDB, and, although a few of
the columns had imported correctly, cells in the infant mortality, birth, and
death rate columns were showing invalid values like &#147;2125.23&#148; and &#147;-38.6&#148; and
some cells in the other columns were showing actual error messages like &#147;FALSE
DATA=ERROR22&#148; and &#147;MISSING SOURCE DATA=ERROR615.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey Sergey?&#148; Marin
said. &#147;I&#8217;m getting all these error messages in PDB.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Sergey rolled over
to Marin&#8217;s desk and looked at her computer screen.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did you have any
blank cells?&#148; asked Sergey.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I typed &#8216;BLANK CELL&#8217; into all the blank cells, like you&#8217;re supposed to.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can I see the
source file?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin minimized the
PDB window and opened BANG_04-Whitman_Stats_MCedits.xls. Sergey took over the
mouse and clicked around on some cells in the spreadsheet, pulled her
error-ridden table in PDB up again, and then clicked back to the spreadsheet. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very strange. It
looks like you did everything correctly. And these two cells are exactly the
same&#151;&#148; Sergey pointed to two adjoining cells on the spreadsheet, both
indicating values of 31.56. &#147;And one imported correctly, and the other is
giving you an error message. I don&#8217;t know. Hey Kendra?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is she getting
ERROR615 without a blank cell?&#148; asked Kendra.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, and 22
without symbols,&#148; said Sergey.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s something to
do with the version of software that was used to create the original
spreadsheet, but I don&#8217;t know how to fix it. She has to ask Adam.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oops,&#148; said
Sergey. &#147;I guess Adam knows how to fix this. I&#8217;ve never seen this before.&#148; He rolled back to his own desk.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
printed both the spreadsheet program and PDB versions of the data set and took
them with her down the hallway to Adam&#8217;s office.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Look, I&#8217;m sorry
man,&#148; a man in Adam&#8217;s office was saying, &#147;I know that you have a lot going on. I&#8217;m sorry to keep making you redo this.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s okay Vipool,
really,&#148; said Adam. &#147;It&#8217;s my own dang fault.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">A tall Indian guy
in his late twenties was leaned against Adam&#8217;s doorjamb. Adam&#8217;s guest was dressed impeccably (if a little too preppily for Marin&#8217;s
taste) and might have been attractive, but there was something specious and
inscrutable in his manner that Marin didn&#8217;t like.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hold up Breese,
looks like you have a visitor,&#148; Vipool said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, Marin, hi, can
I help you with something?&#148; asked Adam.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You must be Marin
Choo,&#148; said Vipool. He smiled a smile of very small, very white teeth. &#147;Hi, I
work with Ray and Jen now. My name&#8217;s Vipool. Vipool Parashar. I&#8217;ve heard a
lot about you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ray is a compulsive
liar, you know,&#148; said Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s a compulsive
many things,&#148; said Vipool.</p>

<p class="Story">They shook hands. </p>

<p class="Story">This wasn&#8217;t the
kind of person that Marin had expected Ray to replace her with&#151;not that she&#8217;d
had any idea that she&#8217;d had any kind of expectations in that regard until this
moment. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You and Adam are
in the middle of something. I can come back,&#148; she said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh no, please, go
ahead,&#148; said Vipool. &#147;I&#8217;m sure Adam here wants a break from redoing my index
tables for the thousandth time, don&#8217;t you Adam?&#148; He patted Adam forcefully on
the shoulder.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Vipool is
publishing in <i>ForeignAffairs</i> and presenting at the CFR conference in
August,&#148; said Adam. &#147;So everything&#8217;s got to be 110% perfect.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, that&#8217;s great,&#148;
said Marin. &#147;Are you presenting about your work here or something else?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;About everything
and nothing,&#148; said Vipool.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s a really
brilliant paper about the relationship between poverty and political unrest in
Central and Southeast Asia,&#148; said Adam.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Breese, you&#8217;ve
clearly been looking at too many index tables,&#148; said Vipool. &#147;It&#8217;s a very
simple paper,&#148; he said to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sounds great,&#148;
said Marin. &#147;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be the toast of the CFR come August. Whether
that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing, I don&#8217;t know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I was going to
say,&#148; Vipool said, &#147;I don&#8217;t know if I want that job, but thanks, both of
you.&#148; He looked at his watch. &#147;I actually have to meet someone in a bit for
lunch so I&#8217;m going to take off. Breese, call my cell if you have any more
questions. Very nice to finally meet you, Marin.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He left.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin wondered, as
Adam&#8217;s computer beeped several times in succession with incoming email traffic,
whether Ray did the smile-frown thing still, and if he did it for Vipool. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Such a nice guy,&#148;
Adam said.</p>

<p class="Story">And Marin, without

<h2>Chicago : 2004</h2>
<h3>Walter</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">W</span>alter didn&#8217;t remember closing his eyes, but
when he opened them, it was no longer nighttime. His watch said 7:07. </p>

<p class="Story">It was not just morning,
it was <i>the </i>morning. The morning of the calls: Jack Jaffrey&#146;s calls to the Midwestern managers and reps in the top fifty of the national rankings and senior VP of sales and marketing Eric Mulrhony&#146;s calls to Fenniskrante&#146;s top ten regional managers (and top ten sales reps) in the country. </p>
<p class="Story">Walter usually scheduled
  himself in the field on <i>the </i>morning&#151;he did not want to be sitting at
  home waiting for a call that never came.</p>

<p class="Story">In fact, Walter had
scheduled himself to be at Dr. Vallabhaneni&#8217;s office in Oglesby at eight-thirty
to shadow his rep Stu Carroll. However, due to a startlingly uncharacteristic
lack of sanity, Walter had let his late wife&#8217;s very persistent best friend
Marisol sign him up for an over-fifty dating service called Silver Chances. The Silver Chances event that Walter had attended the night before (his first
and last) in the ballroom of a hotel in Skokie had turned out to be the site of
the biggest non-school norovirus outbreak in Chicago in a decade. So Walter
had been holed up in his bathroom for the past ten hours with acute emesis and
accelerated intestinal activity. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter stood up
with a crunch and old-lady hobbled to the sink. He turned open the cold water
and the resulting whoosh brought back the blurred-together memory of many, many
flushes from the night before. He washed his face and brushed his teeth,
making a mental note to buy a couple of new toothbrushes that afternoon:
recontamination was not an option.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter went into
his bedroom and called Stu. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sales, this is
Stu,&#148; Walter&#8217;s newest rep answered, sounding like he was having a &#147;10&#148; morning
already. Stu always sounded like he was having a &#147;10&#148; of whatever he was
having.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Heigh Stugh</i>,&#148;
Walter said. He cleared his throat. &#147;Hi, it&#8217;s Walter. I&#8217;ve caught this awful
stomach flu, so I&#8217;m not going to be coming out to Oglesby with you today.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, man, I&#8217;m sorry
Walter,&#148; Stu said. &#147;Stomach flu? That sucks.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll call you in a
few days to reschedule. You doing donuts and latt&#233;s or what?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bagels, lox, and
cream cheese, New York style&#133;&#148; Stu said.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s stomach
turned violently at the mention of smoked fish and spreadable dairy product. &#147;Sounds good, Stu,&#148; he said. &#147;Tell everyone I say &#8216;hi.&#8217;&#148; He started back to
the bathroom.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Will do.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye,&#148; Walter
said. He clicked a button that may or may not have been &#147;Off,&#148; tossed the phone
towards the bed, ran into the bathroom, knelt down in front of the toilet, and
vomited. He would not be having lox for a good long time now, that was for
sure.</p>

<p class="Story">Stu Carroll,
twenty-five, had been working as a sales rep for Fenniskrante for the past three
years, but he was new to Walter&#8217;s team. Nine months ago, Stu had put in for a
transfer from North Carolina to Chicago (apparently, his girlfriend was from
the area and wanted to move back). Usually, if a rep at Stu&#8217;s level wanted to
transfer, he got in the line for open spots and hoped to get lucky. In Stu&#8217;s
case, however, senior management had seemed anxious to accommodate. A
low-performing rep from Walter&#8217;s team had been moved quietly to Gary, Indiana;
Walter had been asked to shift some things around; and a nice slice of west
suburban Chicago had been offered to the whiz kid in North Carolina.</p>

<p class="Story">And Stu <i>was</i>
good, there was no doubt about that. He had that way of talking to people that
made you feel much more interesting and cool and important than you really
were. &#147;Rapport,&#148; they called it in sales. Stu himself had claimed on one
occasion that he could build rapport with anyone. It had been Walter&#8217;s second
or third time shadowing him, and Walter had been having a difficult time
convincing Stu of his need to keep abreast of financial news. There were an
unusually high number of Asian doctors in Stu&#8217;s territory, and they all had a
taste for a handy stock tip or two. It was a strategy that had worked well for
the previous reps covering the same territory. </p>

<p class="Story">Stu, while
acknowledging that this was a smart strategy, had said, &#147;I&#8217;ve got some tricks
that might surprise even you, Walter. Let me just finish the rest of the year
out my way, since I transferred mid-year, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m happy to
do the stock thing next year.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">If Stu had counted
on Walter&#8217;s need to prove himself right, then he had calculated well. Indeed,
for the rest of the sales year, Walter had taken care not to counsel Stu on any
but the most orthodox of Fenniskrante corporate protocol. Dr. Vallabhaneni,
for instance, was a vegetarian&#151;not so strict that he wouldn&#8217;t allow meat in his
kitchen&#151;but Walter would not as a matter of practice have let any of his other
reps bring lox to a vegetarian doctor&#8217;s office. However, if Stu took Walter to
number one, if his nice southern boy routine actually worked, he could bring
Bambi on a barbecue spit to Dr. Vallabhaneni&#8217;s office for all Walter cared. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter went
downstairs to the kitchen to make black tea for his stomach. What a way to spend
<i>the </i>morning. </p>

<p class="Story">Other than, of
course, the big milestones in Marin&#8217;s life (her sixteenth birthday, her
graduations, etc.), the morning of the annual sales ranking calls used to be
the time that Walter missed his late wife Jinny the most. These days (Walter
had turned fifty-four in April), he tended to be envious of his married friends
in a general way, for the prolonged continuity of their marriages. He would
never know the fifty-year-old, the sixty-year-old, the seventy-year-old version
of the button-nosed college girl who&#8217;d brought an entire barbecued lechon<i> </i>pig
to his Toledo, Ohio host family&#8217;s July 4th potluck; the chemical engineer who&#8217;d
run a thirty-person lab while eight months pregnant, the woman who&#8217;d organized
twelve of their fellow passengers on their Alaskan cruise (a 15th anniversary
present from Walter) to successfully lobby for salmon filleting lessons from
the ship&#8217;s executive chef. </p>

<p class="Story">So, even if Walter
could separate Silver Chances&#8217; early evening deliverables from the many hours
of vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness that had come later (he could not),
Sandra the cute Taiwanese divorc&#233;e and Akiko the quirky half-Japanese woman
with the gardening business couldn&#8217;t offer him what he truly craved: a
continuing history.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s water was
boiling, and he turned off the heat. He removed a tea bag from its tiny paper
envelope, dropped it into a mug. He poured hot water on it, and the clean
bitter stench of the steeping leaves calmed his gut for now. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter was still
acutely aware of the time. He had approximately two hours to kill. He had to
maintain a maximum thirty-foot radius from one of the bathrooms in the house at
all times, and yet somehow lose himself in some mindless but consuming task. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter decided to
reorganize his sample closet. Two years had passed since the last
reorganization. The system that he&#8217;d devised at the time had quickly turned
out flawed&#151;it had left way too much room for samples of Fenniskrante&#8217;s
antihistamine, Otoclar, which had been cleared by the FDA for over-the-counter
sale a year and a half ago, and not enough room for other drugs that the powers
that be had decided to push unexpectedly, huge courier boxes of Identol,
Betrufel, Oblion, and Asberix samples showing up on Walter&#8217;s doorstop every
other week. So although he kept the closet looking tidy, there was no guiding
principle to the locations of drugs.</p>

<p class="Story">First Walter pulled
all of the boxes, bottles, and foil-backed sample packets out of the closet&#8217;s
built-in shelves and wire baskets and sorted them on the floor: ENT (Otoclar,
Respiatin, etc.) in the outer left corner; cardio (Identol and the blood
pressure medications Angilexin and Angilexin HCT) in the outer middle section;
gyn (plastic packs of the oral contraceptive Perpetua and boxes of the antifungal
Petrazin) in the outer right; derm with its acne creams, steroid creams, and
anti-scarring gels in the inner left; Betrufel and the popular sleeping pill
Oblion in the inner middle; Walter&#8217;s handy stash of opiates and other pain and
arthritis meds in the inner right; and finally digestive and liver drugs
(Fenniskrante&#8217;s proton pump inhibitor Asberix, the aminosalicylate Calmicol,
and others) tossed to the side in a pile.</p>

<p class="Story">Some of these drugs
were nearly as old as Walter&#8217;s daughter (and Stu Carroll, for that matter). Walter remembered Respiatin&#8217;s launch in 1985. Fenniskrante had rented out
fifteen blocks of rooms just off the beach in San Diego. It had been a
four-day event, starting with two days of presentations by doctors, R&amp;D
managers, a handful of finance guys, and some carefully-placed corporate brass,
all hyping Respiatin until all in attendance had believed that it was nothing
less than a miracle drug that would change the world forever. The next day the
Respiatin sales materials had been rolled out. Bags of Respiatin samples and
giveaway goodies, everything purple and branded with the Respiatin logo, had appeared
on everyone&#8217;s doorstops in the morning. The new sales &#147;detail&#148; (the sales
presentation to be delivered by Fenniskrante&#8217;s reps to doctors all over the
country, as dictated point-by-point by the savants in Sales Development) had
been disseminated&#151;not only through the detail cards and detail books slipped
into the reps&#8217; bags: senior sales managers had also been overheard spouting key
phrases and language from the detail throughout the rest of the weekend. And
finally, on day four, the corporate chaperones had slipped off to Malibu for
champagne and lobster, and a full day of poolside sales team debauchery had begun. </p>

<p class="Story">It had been the
holy grail in Big Pharma for as long as anyone could remember: a non-penicillin
antibiotic with a full antimicrobial spectrum, and Fenniskrante had one, FDA
approval and all. Every single Fenniskrante sales rep at the Respiatin launch,
including Walter, had left convinced that he was going to be a millionaire. However, back in the real world, the crux of their sales detail argument, <i>10%
of your patients are allergic to penicillin, Respiatin is at least as effective
as penicillin, if not better</i>, most doctors had seemed to interpret as: <i>prescribe
Respiatin to my patients who are allergic to penicillin</i>. Sales of
Respiatin had ended up far below expectations that first year.</p>

<p class="Story">Slowly, once they&#8217;d
retailored their message and expectations, Fenniskrante had started cutting a
decent market share with the drug, although never quite overtaking
GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Augmentin. However, Walter remembered more than one doctor&#8217;s
or nurse&#8217;s eyes lighting up in the late eighties and early nineties when he
walked in, rolling his Fenniskrante detail bag behind him. During that time,
there had been only one thing that look could have meant: the office had been
running low on Respiatin samples. </p>

<p class="Story">After Walter had
been promoted to regional manager in 1994, things had started heating up on the
ground. Facing the expiration of their final three Augmentin patents in 1998,
the GSK sales team had gone on the offensive. Rumor (or Fenniskrante internal
corporate propaganda) had it that GSK sales reps throughout the Southwest had
been given free reign to break long-standing industry etiquette and make
misleading aspersions about Respiatin <i>by name</i>. A collection of
twenty-five Fenniskrante Midwest regional managers (including Walter) had congregated
at the Door County lake house of then Midwest VP of sales Hank Miller to hash
out a proper defense strategy. </p>

<p class="last">Augmentin
had to be taken twice a day for ten days, while Respiatin, because of certain
chemical properties inherent in the drug, only had to be taken once a day for
five days. Respiatin&#8217;s simplified dosage requirements had always been a core
point of the sales detail, as patient compliance (and with it a decreased risk
of contributing to the development of drug-resistant bacteria) was much more
likely with Respiatin. The Door County crowd had decided to hone in on the
dosage argument by having their reps highlight the results of a brand new study
(Fenniskrante-sponsored, of course) that showed patient compliance for
Respiatin at a staggering 99%. As for Augmentin, there had been no need to
mention the product by name to doctors. One could just ask questions: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><i>=&gt;
How long do you think that most of your patients keep taking their
antibiotics?&#151;</i>Frankie
the Fenniskrante sales rep would ask.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><b>Dr.
Slow-Adopter would frown and then answer honestly<i>&#151;until their infections
clear.</i></b></p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><i>=&gt;
So about three or four days then?</i>&#151;Frankie would ask.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><b><i>Around
four or five days&#151;</i>the
good doctor would correct.</b></p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin:0"><i>=&gt;
So about the time the standard Respiatin prescription ends, or, for other
antibiotics, when they still have ten more doses left, is that correct?</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story">This strategy had proved
extravagantly effective, and Fenniskrante had grabbed eight more points of
market share in 1995 and 1996, nudging Respiatin&#8217;s total sales past the $1
billion mark. Augmentin&#8217;s patents had expired in 1998, and generics had taken
over. Hank Miller had sent boxes of generic brand amoxicillin/clavulanate to
Walter and the other managers with a jokey victory note (&#147;I Can&#8217;t Believe It&#8217;s
Not Augmentin!&#148; etc.) Walter had sent his entire Respiatin stash with Marin to
college in the fall of 1998, so Walter had actually ended up taking Hank&#8217;s
generics that winter to quash a bad cough that he couldn&#8217;t shake. Walter had
taken all twenty doses of the amoxicillin (his own arguments about patient
compliance and drug-resistant bacteria not being wasted on him). It had been
the end of an era. </p>

<p class="Story">There were so many
memories in this closet: the rep who had taken Otoclar at the beginning of a
sales call to demonstrate the anti-histamine&#146;s non-drowsy effects only to fall asleep in the
driver&#8217;s seat of his car in that same doctor&#8217;s parking lot two hours later; the
Perpetua launch in 1992 that all the male reps had dragged their wives to,
terrified of all the awkward talk about women parts; the spontaneous parties
that had sprung up all over the country when Identol had ascended to the number-one
cholesterol drug spot in 1998 after a protracted battle with
then-Warner-Lambert&#8217;s Lipitor; the insane Betrufel launch in 1993 that had
resulted in twelve paintball-related emergency room visits (and not all the
result of Fenniskrante&#8217;s sizeable U.S. veteran contingent reliving their glory
days&#151;sales people are just the most competitive people on the planet).</p>

<p class="Story">Launches these days
were very different: high-tech and corporate and tame. Litigation-proof. Walter usually only went to the ones in Chicago nowadays. He&#8217;d attended a few
in San Francisco when Marin had been going to college out there. The launch
that he was attending in San Francisco in October would introduce a new
neuropathic pain medication, Dipentra. The location of the launch was no
accident: California was one of the states with a pharmaceutical sales
regulation bill on the ballot in November. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter hadn&#8217;t told
his reps this yet, but he planned to treat them all to dinner at Slanted Door
the night before the launch party if their territory came in at number one this
year. He must have been getting sentimental in his old age: he didn&#8217;t want to
use dinner as extra incentive to fuel their sales; he wanted to surprise them,
give them something just to give it to them.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter heard a
mosquito behind his right ear.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Wrong house, buddy</i>, he thought. <i>You
picked the wrong house to buzz into</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter slowly stretched out to grab
an old tennis shoe from the near corner of the closet floor. He turned around
and watched the bug drift toward the wall and land two inches above an electric
socket.</p>

<p class="Story">The phone rang.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter swatted,
missing his target somehow, and walked quickly to the phone. &#147;UNAVAILABLE ID&#148;
flashed on the phone screen. It was a little too early for <i>the </i>call,
but Walter picked up the cordless.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is Walter
Choo,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello, this is
Ronnie from Satellite XTra &amp; Company&#148; a woman said. &#147;How are you this
morning?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not good, I caught
the norovirus last night,&#148; said Walter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, okay, well&#133;&#148;
said Ronnie.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Norovirus is a
vicious strain of stomach flu. It&#8217;s highly contagious, and its symptoms
include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and basically feeling that you
are about to die.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s&#133; I&#8217;m
sorry,&#148; said Ronnie.</p>

<p class="Story">There was a long
pause. <i>Never try to sell to the salesman</i>, thought Walter.</p>

<p class="Story">The phone beeped
with a call waiting. &#147;E. Mulrhony&#148; and a 312 number flashed on the base&#8217;s
screen, and Walter pounded the desk with the fat outer end of his fist. Top
ten overall! The odds that his reps would be eating Vietnamese food in San
Francisco in July had just shot up to one in ten.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s okay,&#148; said
Walter. &#147;Some things happen for a reason. I&#8217;ve got another call, but thanks
for your call Ronnie.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well okay now, you
have a nice day now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter hung up on
Ronnie and picked up Eric Mulrhony&#8217;s call.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is Walter
Choo,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, Walter. It&#8217;s
Eric from Chicago, how are you doing this morning?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m doing alright,
and yourself?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not too bad, not
too bad. Did you see the Cubs game Friday?&#148; asked Eric.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not pretty,&#148; said
Walter. &#147;They&#8217;ve got to get rid of Sosa. Corked bats? It&#8217;s embarrassing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, these are
the kinds of shenanigans that happen when a decent player thinks that he&#8217;s a
champion.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very true,&#148; said
Walter. &#147;Very true.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Walter, let me
cut to the chase&#151;235-C is thirteenth overall this year.&#148; 235-C was Walter&#8217;s
sales territory. &#147;That&#8217;s pretty good. But you also have the number one sales
rep in the country.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Stu&#8217;s number one?&#148;
said Walter. His face went numb.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s right. We
gave you Stu Carroll, and you somehow dropped five places in the national
ranking since last year. Now, I don&#8217;t have to tell you that you are well liked
on the thirtieth floor. You&#8217;re a consistent performer, and we like consistent. However&#133; how do I say this exactly? Effort is not charm. Not in sales, at
least. There are some who think that you can be a little overbearing on your
reps. I know that your intentions are good, but&#133; Good management is like
getting a dog to go in for a bath. You can&#8217;t just pull him in there on his
leash.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Overbearing? Effort is not charm? </i>A fistful of nausea rose up, not in Walter&#8217;s stomach
this time, but behind, in between his eyes. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sorry,&#148; Eric
continued, &#147;but we&#8217;re having to be extra tough on everyone this year. I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;ve heard about the D.A.R.E. bills.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">D.A.R.E., as in
Drug Abuse Resistance Education, the anti-drug program for grade-schoolers
begun under the Reagan administration in the eighties. That was what people in
Big Pharma were secretly calling the five state bills calling for garish restrictions on
pharmaceutical sales methods and access points, including making it illegal for
companies to access pharmacy prescription data for marketing purposes. It was
a serious thing, but Walter didn&#8217;t see how it related to the condescending
lecture he was being given. <i>Shouldn&#8217;t effort count for more than
charm? </i>Did
the conscious and deliberate crafting of a sales philosophy over twenty years
of loyal service to a company just not count for anything anymore? </p>

<p class="Story">On the bathroom
floor the previous night, Walter had considered in depth the problem of
marketing a pharmaceutical treatment for a brief and self-limiting disease such
as the norovirus. It would have to be marketed to the businesses and schools
that were the likely sites of mass outbreak, he&#8217;d decided. Cruise ships,
hotels, universities, hospitals, schools: these had the most at stake in
limiting the scope and duration of an outbreak. These organizations would be
the purchasers and dispensers of the product. If it were up to individuals to
obtain the drugs on their own, many wouldn&#8217;t, and most probably shouldn&#8217;t,
considering the risk of spreading the disease to their health care providers
and other patients. </p>

<p class="Story">This had been a lot of effort on Walter&#8217;s part, thinking about all of this. Effort that
could have been spent watching ESPN on the floor of his bedroom, or lying in
the fetal position against the tub with a hot towel on his face. No, Walter
had spent his brief breaks between vomiting thinking about <i>how to solve
hypothetical problems related to his job.</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh no,&#148; he said on
the phone to Eric now. &#147;I understand.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks for all of
your hard work, Walter,&#148; Eric said. &#147;You&#8217;re a real team player.&#148; And he hung
up.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>You&#8217;re a real team
player. </i>An
insult disguised as a compliment. People who talked like that really thought
that they were smart, didn&#8217;t they? Really thought that people didn&#8217;t know what
they really meant.</p>

<p class="Story">And yet, Walter
refused to be bitter. He had worked for Fenniskrante for nearly his entire adult
life. He knew this company, and he knew that the last thing that they wanted
was for him to try to be Stu Carroll. Stu Carroll wasn&#8217;t a sales strategy. He
wasn&#8217;t even a sales tactic. He was just a good-looking twenty-five-year-old
kid who sold a lot of drugs. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter walked back
to the sample closet. Its contents were still strewn on the floor. <i>Too
many drugs</i>, he thought. Possibly the first time in his life that he&#8217;d had
that thought. It sounded almost radical after twenty years of boostering the
exact opposite sentiment, but Walter knew that it wasn&#8217;t. </p>

<p class="Story">The mosquito, cocky
with its earlier escape, buzzed small and close at the left of Walter&#8217;s left eye. Walter swatted at it, and the winged black speck hovered in slow motion in
front of his face. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter waited. The
black speck floated a few inches away and back again. </p>

<p class="Story">With a single
forceful motion Walter clapped his hands together on the bug, and he knew with
absolute certainty that it was dead. </p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2002</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">R</span>ay Marcos&#8217;s office was never quiet. Even
when he wasn&#8217;t in it&#151;there was always some device beeping or computer drive
processing or two-hundred-page document printing. </p>

<p class="Story">Ray&#146;s office
had the same effect on people that it did on inanimate objects. In his
office, people became more amplified versions of themselves&#151;unless they were
direct subordinates of Ray and ordinarily very extroverted, in which case Ray&#146;s office had a subduing effect. </p>

<p class="Story">That day, Friday,
at six o&#8217;clock p.m., Ray, Jen Olyphant, and Marin were scheduled to meet in
Ray&#8217;s office with their country heads, who were all in town for Pac&#8217;s
conference the following week, &#147;Back to Basics: a Return to Infrastructure
Development in the Developing East.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">The Thailand country director, Mark Greene, had been quietly working all day in the empty cubicle across from Marin&#8217;s. Marin had (through the cubicle wall) asked him a question about his Thailand presentation, to complete and total silence. It had turned out that he had gone to lunch. Now, at five till six, he was pacing back and forth in Ray&#8217;s office talking theatrically on his cell phone: <i>&#147;No! You&#8217;re kidding me&#133; And you thought I was going crazy&#133; I know! &#133; At least I had the balls to tell him that to his face!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Finnegan Le, Pac&#8217;s
youngest country director at twenty-nine (in charge of Vietnam), had been
running around the San Francisco office all day like an eight-year-old on
Christmas morning. He would come over to Marin and, apropos of nothing, ask
her some inane question like, &#147;Do you like living in such a hilly city?&#148; and
then leave to do something else equally random before she had finished
answering. Finnegan was now standing in the back corner of Ray&#8217;s office
silently reading the spines of journal back issues through the glass doors of his bookcase.</p>

<p class="Story">The director of
Cambodia and Laos was Larissa Booker, a Yalie whose shrub of short brown curls was kept up and away from her face with a series of colorful scarves. Marin liked Larissa&#8217;s quiet, assuasive
schoolteacher&#8217;s voice and manner. Larissa had spent the afternoon rehearsing
her conference presentation in the small conference room next door to Ray&#8217;s
office. She had spread out her index cards in a large grid on the table and
whispered quietly to herself, stopping every so often only to underline a word
or phrase on one of the cards or carefully rearrange their order. She was now
sitting with Jen Olyphant in the cabernet-colored armchairs in front of Ray&#8217;s
desk, exchanging patently exaggerated Asia travel horror stories and laughing
loudly. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin put her
computer to sleep and hurried up the stairs to the eleventh floor to retrieve,
from a meeting about Islamic microfinance, the Indonesia country director,
Wayan Wijaya. Dr. Wijaya was a petite Balinese woman with short
gray-black-white hair and a sweet, heart-shaped face. However, this appearance
was allegedly deceiving. </p>

<p class="Story">Ray had told Marin
once that Dr. Wijaya had a reputation for taking it upon herself to
psychoanalyze people that she&#8217;d just met and give them unsolicited appraisals
of their characters. &#147;I&#8217;ve seen her <i>own </i>bank presidents in ten words or
less,&#148; Ray had said. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin got to the
conference room just as Dr. Wijaya&#8217;s meeting was letting out. The room smelled
like pomegranate seeds and cigarette ash. Marin smiled at the Indonesia
director, and Dr. Wijaya picked up her notes and her emptied paper coffee cup
and walked over. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello, Mareen,&#148;
Dr. Wijaya said&#151;she pronounced Marin&#8217;s name like the first two syllables of
&#147;marina.&#148; &#147;Where are we going to now?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Another meeting,
of course,&#148; said Marin. &#147;With all of the Southeast Asia directors.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, has Dr.
Abdullah arrived?&#148; asked Dr. Wijaya.</p>

<p class="Story">Dr. Azim Abdullah
was the Malaysia/Singapore/Brunei country director.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, his flight
doesn&#8217;t arrive until eleven this evening,&#148; said Marin. She decided not to
mention that no one had any idea where Francis Kiplinger, the Philippines
country director, was. </p>

<p class="Story">They made more
small talk as they walked to the elevator bank. Marin pressed the down button
and gauged the elevators by the numbered round lights above each: one was
stalled on the sixteenth floor; the other was on the ground floor and coming up
slowly. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I read the report
that your office put together on agricultural development in Indonesia,&#148; Marin
said to Dr. Wijaya. </p>

<p class="Story">The country
director nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I found it
extremely fascinating,&#148; Marin continued. &#147;Does your team generally find any
tradeoffs involved in technology transfers like the importation of new crop
hybrids and varieties from Malaysia, or, say, GMO cotton from Monsanto?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mareen,&#148; she
replied, &#147;I was like you&#151;mature for my age... confident... special. But you
are still young. You could not possibly understand this question you asked me, nor my answer, until you learn that you, too, are not <i>immune
to opportunity</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course I&#8217;m
not,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I know that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You don&#8217;t,&#148; said
Dr. Wijaya. &#147;Not really. I can tell.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">An elevator dinged
open. They got in and rode the elevator to the tenth floor in silence. Ray
had given Marin fair warning, but she was still irritated. All the same, she
knew that she wouldn&#8217;t be getting the phrase &#147;immune to opportunity&#148; out of her
head any time soon. Marin wouldn&#8217;t have been bothered by it so much&#151;she hadn&#8217;t
grown up under the roof of one Walter Choo only to succumb so easily to Grade B
crypto-fascist mind games&#151;except that this was the second time within a week
that a near stranger had decided to oh-so-kindly inform Marin about herself. </p>

<p class="Story">On Monday, that
weird primatologist guy, Will, had called Marin&#8217;s semi-secret direct line at
work, out of the blue, offering her some kind of job. In Borneo. In the
middle of the jungle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We want you to
know that this is a very serious offer,&#148; Will had said. &#147;We know that you
wouldn&#8217;t come without a genuine need for your specific services and skill set
here.&#148; He then, at length, had detailed that need: </p>

<p class="Story">The U.S. FDA had
just announced that it would soon require food companies to disclose on product
labels the amount of trans fat contained per serving. What did this have to do with
orangutans in the Borneo jungle?</p>

<p class="Story">In response to a trendy new obsession with trans fat by Western news media, according to Will, multinational food
companies were not switching to truly healthy oils like canola and sunflower
oils, but rather to cheap, zero-trans-fat, high-saturated-fat palm oil. This
put the O/URC&#8217;s mortal enemies, the oil palm companies, firmly in bed with some
of the biggest names in world consumer goods.</p>

<p class="Story">This had sounded
evil and Orwellian to Marin, but a lot of things sounded evil and Orwellian to
Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The 20,000
hectares that we came to Pac about is just the beginning,&#148; Will had continued. &#147;There is so much momentum behind the palm oil industry, and Wan and I are
scientists, not politicians. We don&#8217;t have time, and, as you&#8217;ve witnessed
firsthand, we don&#8217;t really know how to make the best case for the orangutans to
the powers-that-be. However, we can&#8217;t just hire some random consultant
somewhere to throw statistics at someone like a Nestl&#233; or a Cargill. The
difficult work of changing someone else&#8217;s mind has a chance of succeeding only
if it comes from a real understanding of what makes the rainforest and all of
its native residents so special.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I was the most
sympathetic person from Pac at your presentation last month,&#148; Marin had said,
&#147;but I think you got the wrong impression. I don&#8217;t have any environmental
experience to speak of.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s what makes
you such a perfect person for this job. You&#8217;re not the converted.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But isn&#8217;t that a
catch-22? If I&#8217;m not even convert<i>ed</i>, how do you think you&#8217;re going to
convince me to become a convert<i>er</i>?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because you&#8217;re
working for a bureaucracy right now,&#148; Will had said. &#147;It&#8217;s going to take years
for you to advance to a position where you can make a real impact on things. And by the time that happens, it would be a miracle if you haven&#8217;t already
turned cynical, bitter, and unrecognizable to yourself, so that you no longer
have the will to make the changes that you can. You will know far more about
the internal politics of an international development organization than you
will about any of the countries or people that you are trying to help. I&#8217;m
offering you a chance to skip all of that and start changing the world now,
while you still have a soul. And I&#8217;ll be honest with you&#151;we could fail&#151;but a
failure for you, at twenty-three, is not going to make much of a difference to
your career either way. And the flipside is that we succeed: and you will have
the reputation and experience of having successfully lobbied several
multinational companies to recognize the environmental impact of palm oil,
shaped the growth of a major agricultural industry in Asia, and helped preserve
the sole remaining wild population of a species of major scientific and
anthropological interest worldwide. Plus, I can promise you one thing that I
know Pac can&#8217;t: as long as you&#8217;re here with us, win or lose, you&#8217;re going to
have fun.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know if I
can trust someone who talks in Disney movie clich&#233;s,&#148; Marin had said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;See?&#148;
Will had replied. &#147;It&#8217;s already begun.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Marin and Dr. Wijaya shut the door of Ray&#8217;s
office behind them, and the meeting commenced.</p>

<p class="Story">Ray pouted at the
draft conference itinerary that his secretary had printed for him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where&#8217;s the
financial crisis panel?&#148; he demanded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Monday, eleven
a.m.,&#148; said Mark. &#147;Wayan and I met with the South Korea director earlier
today. And Azim has been ready for this for a year.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone
laughed&#151;the Malaysia country director was known to have strong feelings about
the IMF&#8217;s heavy-handed handling of the 1997 Asian economic crisis.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Larissa and
Finnegan,&#148; said Ray. &#147;How does Indochina look?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m scheduled to
speak Tuesday at three,&#148; said Larissa. &#147;And Finnegan is following me in the
same room. We&#8217;re going to do a combined Q and A after the Vietnam
presentation. Then we have that NGO panel about rural infrastructure. And
Wednesday&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">At office meetings
lately, Marin had gotten into the bad habit of thinking about <i>meetings</i>&#151;not
specific meetings, and certainly not the ones that she was in&#151;meetings, in
general. To begin with, it was such a funny, almost avant garde, word: a
gerund bullied by use and abuse into an actual noun, requiring the use of
articles or adjectives to clarify its definiteness. <i>I have a meeting at
ten. Yesterday&#8217;s meeting went well. </i></p>

<p class="Story">With the conference
coming up, there were at least six other meetings happening at Pac right now. Additionally, elsewhere around San Francisco and Silicon Valley, in Hollywood and L.A., in Sacramento, Seattle,
Portland, and Vancouver, there must have been thousands of meetings going on
even at this late-ish hour of six o&#8217;clock: extra-industrious lawyers and
architects and financial analysts and engineers and management consultants and
entertainment executives and journalists and marketing directors getting one
last item off the agenda before leaving for the night. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin wondered if
the temperature of the earth in each longitude changed from the hours of nine
to six each day due to so many bodies hunched around conference tables and
desks, so many of their powerful and multiplying species reduced for extended
periods of time to a ritual act of limited utility. Four months into her first
real job, how many hours of Marin&#8217;s own life had already been lost listening to
somebody get lost in a preamble, hover near a point, retreat into the comfort
of familiar phrases (&#147;our latest projections,&#148; &#147;the maturation of these
economies,&#148; &#147;the international development community&#148;), contradict themselves
vaguely, make a joke, generalize, backtrack, lather, rinse, repeat? </p>

<p class="Story">It wasn&#8217;t that she
had meetings with people who weren&#8217;t intelligent&#151;the people she had meetings
with were almost always incredibly intelligent. Intelligence, Marin had come
to realize, was a quality not best uncovered through meetings.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin,&#148; Ray said. &#147;How many countries are represented by the attendees this weekend?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Forty-six,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Forty-six
countries in attendance,&#148; Ray said. &#147;The international development community
realizes the importance of this issue of infrastructure in the future
development of countries in all stages of development in Asia. China may have
the biggest projects and ambition, but Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia
and Vietnam seek to benefit from an enormous boost to both industry and tourism
from the construction of simple infrastructure projects. In fact, I would like
to take the opportunity of this conference to encourage multinational
infrastructure development projects for ASEAN countries&#151;let us not
underestimate what a connected Indochina or a better-connected Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Philippines could mean for the maturation of these economies and
boosting numbers and productivity across the board. My point being that, we
should be cognizant of how the topic of infrastructure applies in general to
the entire Pac purview of Asia, but also specifically to the Southeast Asian
region and our&#151;what is it now?&#151;nine countries? They keep changing it on me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Finnegan raised his
hand, and Ray called on him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I see a two-hour
orientation on the itinerary on Sunday. Are we supposed to attend this, or is
this for non-Pac staff only?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Why, do you have
better places to be?&#148; Ray asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, I was just
wondering. Not sure what I need orienting to,&#148; Finnegan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You need orienting
to your free sandwich,&#148; Mark said.</p>

<p class="Story">Jen and Larissa
laughed.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Go
schmooze, meet people, get some business cards, learn some names,&#148; Ray said. &#147;That&#8217;s probably the best part of the conference; I don&#8217;t know why you would
want to skip it.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">After the meeting with the Southeast Asia
country directors, Ray, Jen, and Marin met for another forty minutes alone. After that, Marin did emails for another half-hour. At eight-thirty exactly
she grabbed her stuff, taxied home, went straight to her car, and drove to
Mountain View for her friend Nazneen&#8217;s twenty-second birthday party.</p>

<p class="Story">It was almost ten
o&#8217;clock when Marin pulled up to the townhouse that Nazneen was renting with two
of her graduate school friends on the winding suburban street that always
confounded Marin. To get to Nazneen&#8217;s house, 34 Hierba Street, Marin had to
turn off the street that she thought was Hierba, and then curve around north
and west a mile from where the house seemed to be on her map. Just when she
thought that she was lost, she&#8217;d see the pink house with the royal-purple
crescent moon lantern hanging from the large tree in front: 34 Hierba Street.</p>

<p class="Story">There were
approximately twenty cars parked in front of the house and neighboring houses,
a few bicycles on Nazneen&#8217;s lawn, and one motorcycle parked on a narrow strip
of Nazneen&#8217;s driveway to the right of someone&#8217;s Mercedes SUV. Marin
parallel-parked in an empty spot across the street, got out of her car, and
beeped it locked with the remote on her keychain. She heard hip hop music and
the almost orchestral clamor of fifty newly-minted adults talking all at once. A dog barked in the distance.</p>

<p class="Story">A girl wearing a
red raincoat and a couple of guys were standing outside on the lawn smoking. As Marin made her way up the driveway, she recognized the smokers as classmates
from Stanford that she didn&#8217;t know well. She also recognized the sweet and
pungent skunk of marijuana. </p>

<p class="Story">The red raincoat girl recognized her and waved. &#147;Hey, Marin!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin waved back.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think Naz is in
the kitchen,&#148; the girl said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Thanks,
I&#8217;ll look for her,&#148; said Marin. She hurried along the narrow walkway and up
two low steps onto the porch, circling a narrow isthmus of brown mulch that
smelled like eucalyptus and wet heather. She opened the door and went in.</p>

<p class="first">Nazneen had been throwing the same party
since freshman year of college. Drinks: one keg of beer; five six-packs of
fruity vodka coolers; bottles of Jose Cuervo, Malibu, Stoli, cranberry juice,
pineapple juice, and diet cola (Nazneen famously hated citrus); and a bag of
ice. Music: Nazneen&#8217;s KZSU deejay friend (a sexually-ambiguous Science,
Technology, and Society major named Joss) updated Nazneen&#8217;s MP3 library a day
or two before the party; Nazneen patched her laptop into her thousand-dollar
subwoofer and speaker system; and Joss&#8217;s picks ran, shuffle on, in a loop. Food: at least one tableful of homemade Persian food made by the host. And lighting: ceiling lights off or dimmed and replaced with small shaded lamps
and jar candles that smelled like honey.</p>

<p class="Story">A Nazneen party was
never not fun. Things happened at a Nazneen party. Marin knew of at least
five still-existing couples who had first fallen in love under the spell of
Nazneen Abadi&#8217;s lamb in lavash. And, of course, that wasn&#8217;t counting the many
dozens of couples, like Marin and Max, who had met at a Nazneen party and were
no longer together. </p>

<p class="Story">However, as Marin
made herself a Stoli and diet cola at the makeshift bar set up on a table in
the living room and smelled the Nazneen party smell of spiced meat,
sweet melting wax, and coconut rum, Marin found herself running through the
schedule for Pac&#8217;s upcoming conference. As part of the welcome committee, in
less than forty-eight hours, Marin would be meeting dozens of ministers of
finance, senior policy advisors, World Bank and IMF economists, and senior
executives of major international engineering corporations. She would rather
not have the Nelly song <i>Hot in Herre</i> stuck in her head at that time.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin decided to go
look for Nazneen in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="Story">She was halfway
down the hallway when she heard someone yell &#147;Marin!&#148; behind her. It was Jorge Jones-Ramirez, who, tonight, was
making the rounds with Maya Reynolds, a girl from their class whose angelic
face, long blonde curls, and tendency to waft around rooms without a strong
sense of direction gave her the aura of a Greek Muse. Marin greeted them both
with hugs and kisses on respective cheeks, and they caught up. Marin told them
about Pac&#8217;s conference that weekend, and Jorge talked about his internship at
the technology magazine <i>Wired</i>, which apparently involved going to a lot
of tech industry parties, getting drunk on Midori sours, and talking about the
latest startups to be given their death sentence on FuckedCompany.com. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Benjamin&#8217;s here,&#148;
Jorge said. &#147;He brought his new girlfriend.&#148; He seemed disproportionately
amused by this factual statement.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I didn&#8217;t know that
he was seeing anyone,&#148; said Marin. &#147;That&#8217;s either very brave or very stupid of
him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wish that I had
someone to be very brave or stupid with,&#148; Maya said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think Marin
means that it&#8217;s brave of Ben to bring his new girlfriend to his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s
birthday party,&#148; said Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Still&#133;&#148; said Maya.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you still
seeing that guy from work?&#148; Marin asked Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, things are
going pretty well with him. I tried to bring him tonight, but Mountain View
was kind of a hard sell. And I don&#8217;t mean that as a double entendre.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s not much
arousing about Mountain View,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s not much
arousing about anything outside of 45 Ocean Avenue, Apartment 3D these days,&#148;
said Maya.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maya&#8217;s stalking
this guy that she met in yoga class,&#148; Jorge said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s just so
beautiful&#133;&#148; Maya said. &#147;Hey, is that Rio Parker? I haven&#8217;t seen her since she
vomited her brains out in the Mirrielees barbecue pit the night before
graduation.&#148; Maya sashayed, Muse-like, into the living room.</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge and Marin exchanged smiles: Maya hadn&#146;t changed one bit.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Our friends are so
classy, ain&#8217;t they?,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;I guess I should say &#8216;hi&#8217; to Rio. Laters, Marin.&#148; He patted Marin on the back and walked off in Maya&#8217;s direction.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin made it to
the kitchen, where there was no sign of Ben or Nazneen, but where her friends
Becky and Max were sitting on bar stools at the kitchen island eating Persian
food out of paper bowls. Marin hugged Becky and Max <i>hello</i>, served
herself some rice and eggplant stew, and pulled up a stool on Becky&#8217;s left.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Naz still can&#8217;t
bring herself to buy a carton of orange juice?&#148; said Max.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think it&#8217;s
something about rinds that she doesn&#8217;t like,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Rinds <i>are</i>
weird,&#148; said Becky. &#147;They&#8217;re like kind of tough and waterproof, but soft and
spongy underneath. And they have so much fragrance and flavor.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where is the
birthday girl anyway?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She was going to
eat with us, but some people from her co-term program came and stole her away,&#148;
said Max. &#147;They kept badgering her about where she&#8217;s planning on
&#8216;interviewing.&#8217; Since when did interviewees get permission to use &#8216;interview&#8217;
as an active verb?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Our generation
likes to pretend that we have control over things that we don&#8217;t actually have
control over,&#148; said Becky. &#147;It&#8217;s part of our charm.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How&#8217;s <i>your</i>
job search going?&#148; Marin asked Max.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, I have been
inter<i>viewed </i>at a couple of places,&#148; he said. He finished his food and
began splitting the rim of his bowl open by rubbing into it with the side of
his index finger. &#147;There&#8217;s this small architecture firm in Daly City that&#8217;s
looking for a planner, but I think they want someone with more experience than,
well, zero. And I went in for an interview at the San Francisco Redevelopment
Agency last week. I haven&#8217;t heard back from them yet, though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;ll find
something,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then you&#8217;ll
wish that you just did a co-term like Naz,&#148; said Becky. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Still not enjoying
the nine-to-five life, huh?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Becky mimed a shot
gun to her head and pulled the trigger. &#147;So I go into this meeting yesterday,&#148;
she said. &#147;And our client has brought over all these samples from her new
cosmetic line so that we can help her, like, sell them. And all the other
girls break out their compact mirrors and packs of special makeup remover wipes
and start removing soaking beige tissue after soaking beige tissue of makeup so
that they can actually test the products on something resembling human skin. And then the client starts explaining how the makeup &#8216;works&#8217; or whatever, and
it literally makes absolutely no sense. She goes, <i>&#8216;the built-in steam vapor
technology means that when you put on your foundation in the morning, you are
actually giving yourself a facial at the same time.&#8217;</i> And everyone starts
ooh-ing and ahh-ing, even the macho straight guys who go to the shooting range
every Thursday after work. And then the client goes, <i>&#8216;I need a marketing
plan that says to the world: this is not just makeup. This is a whole new
life.&#8217;</i> And everyone starts clapping.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That would be
hilarious if it wasn&#8217;t completely depressing,&#148; said Max.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;M GETTING
SOMETHING TO EAT, DO YOU WANT ANYTHING TO EAT LEONA?&#148; a familiar voice shouted,
the voice&#8217;s owner walking backwards into the kitchen. Nazneen was wearing
tight black pants and three-inch heels, which boosted her natural
five feet and nine inches to a full two yards. Her hair was cut into a chic bob
that curled in at a sharp angle. She turned, saw Marin, and threw up her hands
theatrically. &#147;Oh my god, when did you get here?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Happy birthday!&#148;
said Marin, standing up and smiling.</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen rushed her
with a bear hug. She smelled slightly of plums and suffused the air around them
with a sniffing, animal warmth.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Chookie! How are
you doing, my sweets?&#148; said Nazneen. &#147;Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god&#133;&#148; With
the second &#147;oh my god,&#148; Nazneen had grabbed Marin&#8217;s hand. With the third, she
had marched Marin down the hall to an empty bedroom and shut the door behind
them. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Ben has
seriously lost his mind,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;This woman he&#8217;s dating, she&#8217;s a <i>political
activist. </i>Ben Blakeman is the least political person that I know!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Don&#8217;t let him get
to you,&#148; said Marin. &#147;It&#8217;s your birthday, and you look hot! How do you get
your hair to do that?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh god, my
hairdresser&#8217;s out of town, so I let her assistant do me. I look like a fucking
16th century Italian pageboy,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;She&#8217;s old, too. Ben&#8217;s new
girlfriend. Thirty or forty. Isn&#8217;t that weird? How did they even meet?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe she&#8217;s an art
lover,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did you know about
this?&#148; asked Nazneen. &#147;You don&#8217;t seem that surprised.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, I didn&#8217;t even
know that he was seeing anybody,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I guess I haven&#8217;t seen him in
awhile.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;See, that&#8217;s just
weird. They&#8217;ve been dating for a month and a half, and he doesn&#8217;t even tell
you, his good friend in the city, about her?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve been busy at
work,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I haven&#8217;t met her yet, but you&#8217;re right&#151;she doesn&#8217;t really
sound like his type.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know, right?&#148;
said Nazneen. &#147;It&#8217;s been three years since we broke up. I don&#8217;t know why I
still let him get to me like this. Maybe because I&#8217;m still at the same fucking
school with all of the same fucking people running the same fucking Campus
Drive loop that I&#8217;ve been running for <i>four years</i>.&#148; She seemed tired.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin patted
Nazneen on the shoulder. When they had pulled all-nighters together freshman
year, Nazneen would draw upon a nameless internal energy source in times of
need. She would close her eyes for a second and upon reopening them be ready
for another hour of focused work. </p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen did this
now, and then, refreshed, opened the door.</p>

<p class="Story">Some of Nazneen&#8217;s
Pi Phi sisters were right outside the door and swiftly claimed her to referee
some inane dispute.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin went back
into the kitchen. Max was gone, but Becky was still sitting in the same spot. She was talking to Jorge, who was standing in front of her with his scarf, jacket, and hat on. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you taking
off?&#148; Marin asked Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, I&#8217;m supposed
to go to this party back in the city,&#148; he said. &#147;Do you want a ride?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, I&#8217;ve got my
car,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re going to
have a cigarette first,&#148; said Becky, standing up and grabbing a gray jacket
slung over the edge of the counter. &#147;Do you want to have a cigarette with us?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m still not a
cool enough customer for that stuff,&#148; said Marin. &#147;Sorry.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are you
talking about?&#148; said Jorge. &#147;You&#8217;re the coolest customer I know, Marin Choo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They hugged,
promised to see each other more in the city, and Jorge and Becky left. </p>

<p class="Story">Sometimes, in the
middle of a particularly soul-draining week at Pac, Marin felt prematurely
nostalgic for her college life and friends. Then, when Marin actually saw her
college friends, she remembered how much she resented playing the straight man
to Nazneen&#8217;s live wire, how bored she was with Max&#8217;s inert pretensions, and even how stupidly jealous she was of the doubled momentum propelling Jorge (who had finally come out of the closet earlier that year) forward into his post-collegiate, openly gay life. </p>

<p class="Story">Even before that
Will guy had called Marin, something had been bothering her about him&#151;about
both him and Wan&#151;ever since their presentation at Pac. She hadn&#8217;t been able to
put her finger on it until now. She had just sensed that something about them
went against the laws of nature, something about them was just wrong. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>They believed
completely in the work that they were being paid to do</i>. That was it: the
extraterrestrial activity that Marin had detected was <i>professional
fulfillment</i>. No realist concessions, no means-to-an-end Faustian bargains:
was it really possible that she had never yet met another person who had
achieved the simple goal of authentic professional fulfillment? She had, of
course, met people who liked their jobs&#151;her parents were/had been
workaholics, many of her teachers seemed content with summers off and the
chance to inspire the brighter minds of the next generation, and Ray of course
had his fantastically diseased twenty-year relationship with Pac. However,
none of these people had Will&#8217;s and Wan&#8217;s absolute conviction that what they
were doing was exactly what they were meant to do.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin!&#148; another
familiar voice exclaimed. Her friend Ben had come into the kitchen, holding
hands with a beautiful Chinese woman wearing vintage denim and an adorable pair
of nougat-colored boots. Ben himself looked taller than when Marin had last
seen him one month ago in the city, where he lived and worked also. He&#8217;d
always been one of the handsomest guys in their class, but had had a hobbit-like
scruff and bend to his proportions and manner that was gone now. He waved
Marin over. &#147;There&#8217;s someone I want you to meet,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin introduced
herself.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, this is my
girlfriend, Judith,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m so happy to
finally meet you,&#148; Judith said. &#147;Ben has told me so much about you and your
work.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Judith works with
health care issues at BAARC,&#148; said Ben. &#147;I told her about your thesis.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you&#8217;re working
at Pac now?&#148; asked Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, I work for
Ray Marcos, who&#8217;s the head of Southeast Asia research and development,&#148; said
Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s the
intense, kooky guy, right?&#148; asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ray is the one
you&#8217;ve heard about, yes,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My very, very good
friend Anastasia, who Ben knows very well,&#148; said Judith. </p>

<p class="Story">They smiled at each
other&#151;an inside joke.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Anastasia
Richards,&#148; said Ben, with a silent shudder.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, Anastasia has
far more Asian street cred than me because she grew up in Bangkok and Seoul. Every South Korean of a certain age knows the name Frank Richards.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Frank Richards,
former ED of Pac?&#148; said Marin. &#147;Who took a bullet for Park Chung-Hee?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know if he
took a bullet for him, or if he just ducked the wrong direction,&#148; said Judith. &#147;Anastasia was born a month after the 1968 assassination attempt in a nuclear
bunker guarded by U.S. agents.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know Frank
Richards&#8217; daughter?&#148; asked Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Anastasia is one
of my closest friends,&#148; Judith said, nodding.</p>

<p class="Story">If Judith was close
in age to Anastasia, who was born in 1968, that put her at around thirty-four
years old. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And Frank Richards
is a class act,&#148; Judith continued. &#147;I think the regional banks like Pac are a
little bit more responsible than their Bretton-Woods cousins in D.C. A little
bit more accountable to the people. The World Bank makes this huge deal about
the billions of dollars of HIV antiretrovirals that it&#8217;s distributing in
Africa, billions of dollars which go straight to pharmaceutical companies while
prevention education&#151;which has shown incredibly effective in reducing infection
rates in Thailand&#151;falls by the wayside.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Of course</i> the very next
person that Marin met would be a person who also had a firm grasp on the Holy
Grail of authentic professional fulfillment. Marin wasn&#8217;t sure yet that she
trusted this type of person&#151;Will, Wan, Judith&#151;they had something precious, and
knew it. This knowledge gave them a dangerous advantage over everyone else.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, we&#8217;re a
little more under the radar, which can make it easier to get things done,&#148; said
Marin. &#147;And as much as Pac would love to take credit for Thailand&#8217;s HIV prevention
education success: that was all the brilliant work of the Thai government.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s just these
companies&#151;BMS, <i>Fenniskrante</i>, Pfizer&#133; they flog their patents and
research costs, make the public feel guilty about buying generics, all the
while knowing full well that they spend almost twice as much on marketing than
R&amp;D. It&#8217;s a dirty little secret that sixty cents of every dollar that we
spend on medicine in the U.S. is spent on an ad campaign designed to convince
us to pop pills for our problems instead of hitting the gym or eating
vegetables or having safe sex. And the World Bank readily transposes this
model around the world.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The majority of
pharmaceutical marketing budgets is free samples, though,&#148; said Marin,
wondering if Judith had really placed extra emphasis on Fenniskrante&#8217;s name or
if she was imagining things. Had Ben told Judith that Marin&#8217;s dad was a sales
manager there? </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Since when does
Marin Choo defend Big Pharma?&#148; asked Ben. He seemed to be enjoying this,
whatever it was.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, I just know
from my thesis research that that figure is misleading,&#148; said Marin. &#147;The term
&#8216;marketing&#8217; implies advertisements, but that figure that you quoted includes
the market value of sample drugs that drug companies give out for free to
health care providers.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, free doesn&#8217;t
automatically mean harmless,&#148; said Judith. &#147;When it carries a brand name or
comes with a sales pitch, &#8216;free&#8217; or not, it&#8217;s advertising.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s true,&#148; said
Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, we should
hang out together in the city more,&#148; said Ben. &#147;It&#8217;s crazy that I haven&#8217;t seen
you in a month.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know&#133;&#148; said
Marin. &#147;This weekend I&#8217;m crazed, but next weekend I&#8217;m pretty free.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I&#8217;m free
next Friday night,&#148; he said. &#147;Except, actually&#133;&#148; He looked at Judith as if he
could download the necessary calendar data through sustained eye contact with
her. &#147;I&#8217;ll have to get back to you on that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin got it:
Judith was Ben&#8217;s ticket out. He was just as tired of the
Nazneen-Becky-Maya-Jorge-Max contingent as Marin was. Even Nazneen was tired of
it. Instead of enduring the same parties, mini-dramas, and conversations ad
infinitum, Ben had crossed through a magic door to a world filled with fairy
tale creatures like the tacitly alarming daughters of famous technocrats, sexy
agitprops with a bat phone to The Moment, and god knows what other
well-rounded, high-functioning adults.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know where to
reach me,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think we&#8217;re
heading back to the city&#151;do you need a ride?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, I have my car,
and I think I&#8217;m going to hang out a wee bit longer,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben nodded, briefly
letting go of Judith&#8217;s hand to hug Marin good-bye.</p>

<p class="Story">They left, and
Marin suddenly felt exhausted. She went back into the empty bedroom that
Nazneen had dragged her into earlier, shut the door behind herself, and plopped
backwards onto the bed, the comforter down giving way with a soft wheeze. Marin pressed down gently with both hands on the flat space between her belly
and hips where, perhaps, unaccountably, a child might one day be. The room was
one of the housemates&#8217; bedrooms: Marin felt the scratchy cotton of the
housemate&#8217;s duvet cover on the inch of lower back where her top had rode up. Marin closed her eyes and listened to the dimwitted roar of her twenties
passing her by.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had always been
ahead of the curve about stuff like this. Marin had too, though. That was the
thing. </p>

<p class="Story">She felt the
brutal, nonsensical panic of the perfectionist: if she was behind the curve on
this, what else/who else was she behind the curve on?</p>

<p class="Story">She opened her eyes
and propped herself up on her elbows. There were several framed photographs on
the shelf in front of her, and a framed diploma: this was Shelly Yang&#8217;s room. How had Marin not known that Shelly Yang was one of Nazneen&#8217;s housemates? </p>

<p class="Story">Shelly was another
Stanford classmate. An international relations major like Marin, Shelly had
been in a lot of Marin&#8217;s classes. Despite this, Marin didn&#8217;t know her well. She knew that Shelly used to be really conservative and Christian; Shelly had
been heavily involved in a Christian students&#146; group on campus and had organized
missions to South America during the spring breaks of their sophomore and
junior years. Something must have happened during the summer of 2001, though,
because Marin kept running into a very drunk Shelly at parties senior year, and
Marin had a blurry memory of seeing Shelly smoking a pipe at a Dead House party
the week before graduation. Also, Marin had heard that Shelly and Max had
dated briefly this past summer, and Max was a raging atheist in the vein of
Bertrand Russell. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin stood up and
walked over to the desk in the corner. A pink laptop sat closed in the center
of the L-shaped desk. To its right was a lavender-colored mouse on a mousepad
with an unfamiliar logo on it: </p>

<div class="tripcapture"><%= image_tag "books/o/tripcapture.png", alt: "Tripcapture" %></div>

<p class="Story">There was a press
release sitting on top of a short stack of papers to the left of the computer. It was printed on Tripcapture letterhead, with a miniature version of the
mousepad logo printed in the upper right-hand corner. It read:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt"><b>PR
NEWSWIRE: Element Capital Buys 40% Stake in New Web Venture</b></p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">Palo Alto,
California&#151;Leading venture capital firm, Element Capital LP, has provided
$460,000 of startup funds to Tripcapture, Inc., a travel fares search website
established by recent graduates of Stanford University earlier this year. In
exchange, as per the agreement signed by both companies, Element Capital will
have a 40% equity stake in this promising new tech company.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">In addition
to aggregating available airfares for purchase onto a single, easy-to-use
website, Tripcapture.com makes use of a unique proprietary algorithm to track
fluctuations in commercial airfare prices over time, and alert subscribing
users when prices for the flights they need have reached their likely bottom.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">The idea
for Tripcapture.com came when Tripcapture founder and CEO Shelly Yang, as a
student, organized 20-30 person groups of student volunteers to travel to rural
Venezuela and Colombia during their spring vacation to build schools and
medical clinics.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:0">&#147;Since I was responsible for booking flights for 25
people, I became obsessed with checking airfares online every few hours,&#148; Yang
recalled. &#147;If the price went up or down $20, that was $500 more or less that
we would have to raise in donations for the trip.&#148;</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">Marin understood
the utility of a price-tracking algorithm for individual consumers, but if
Shelly had booked flights for twenty-five people, couldn&#8217;t she just have
negotiated a group rate with the airline? It seemed exactly the wrong selling
point. Marin skimmed the rest of the press release&#151;that seemed to be the only
suspect part of the impressive, if servicey, announcement. Marin had clearly
underestimated Shelly.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin remembered
coming home from an ordinary high school day to an &#147;emergency&#148; meeting of
Fenniskrante drug reps in her living room: some competitor company had
committed some egregious breach of drug sales code and her father and his reps
were planning their retaliation. Someone shouted something incendiary, and all
sixteen Fenniskrante numbskulls broke out into a unison chant: &#147;<i>Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">As much as Marin
hated to admit it, the Choo competitive streak had not skipped her generation. Marin was not a jealous ex-girlfriend, but the thought that Max and Shelly may
have had sex in this room, on that scratchy duvet-covered bed, now agitated her far more than could be accounted for by the mix of annoyance and affection that constituted the current state of her feelings for Max.</p>

<p class="Story">The only time that
Marin had given Shelly more than a passing thought before tonight was when they
had gotten into that weird debate about model minorities a few years ago. It was
during a TA-led section for a history class, &#147;Race and America,&#148; that Marin had
taken to satisfy her American Cultures core requirement. That week the
syllabus had been devoted to discussing the &#147;model minority&#148; stereotype of
Asian-Americans which had emerged in the eighties and nineties. Marin had
taken issue with the assigned readings because they uniformly emphasized that
the problem with the model minority label was that it didn&#8217;t fit all APA
communities and individuals. Newer, economically-disenfranchised immigrants
from countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, the readings argued, were overlooked
for public assistance programs, affirmative action, and other needed forms of
outreach because of the &#147;model minority&#148; stereotype. In Marin&#8217;s opinion it was
asinine to criticize a pithy stereotype for its poor representation of
reality. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s problem
with the &#147;model minority&#148; label was in the instances where it was, for all
intents and purposes, a correct representation of reality. &#147;The word &#8216;model&#8217;
implies a hollow kind of success which I think unfortunately describes many
middle class Asian-Americans exactly,&#148; she had argued during section. &#147;Asian-Americans in the past twenty years have as a group achieved a rapid
economic upward mobility that is all the more startling for the lack of
corresponding cultural and political empowerment.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I take offense at
that,&#148; Shelly had said. &#147;I&#8217;m proud of my parents for the success that they&#8217;ve
achieved. And with money comes<i> </i>cultural and political power.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not saying
that economic success is not something to be proud of,&#148; Marin had replied. &#147;I&#8217;m just saying that it&#8217;s not everything. Many middle class Asian-Americans
have voluntarily forfeited their voices in the politics and culture of this
country in order to single-handedly pursue economic and professional success.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well that&#8217;s just
being smart, isn&#8217;t it?&#148; Shelly had said. &#147;I think a lot of people from our
parents&#8217; generation came from countries with limited opportunities, political
and economic, and the attraction of America was that hard work could actually
lead to a better life. I don&#8217;t think they should be faulted for focusing on that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s one thing to
make a thoughtful, considered compromise,&#148; Marin had said. &#147;It&#8217;s another thing
to not think about the trade-offs that you&#8217;re making, to play by rules which
limit your own potential status in a society because you don&#8217;t want to incite
the resentment or outrage of groups who are in power.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What &#8216;rules?&#8217;&#148;
Shelly had said, to snickering from their fellow classmates. &#147;I must have
missed the memo about these mysterious &#8216;rules&#8217; you speak of, Marin. We&#8217;re in a
discussion section of a class at a top five American university, which is being
led by an African-American woman, with classmates of all colors and genders,
and we, two Asian-American women, are dominating the discussion. I don&#8217;t feel
too oppressed right now, honestly.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Well,
Shelly,&#148; Marin had said, &#147;I find your defensiveness on this topic extremely
telling. I just fear that whenever people are taking money and not asking
questions&#151;there&#8217;s something dangerous about that. And I just want people to
ask questions. It&#8217;s obvious what my father has gotten from working hard within
the existing system&#151;a nice house in the suburbs, a great education for me, his
daughter&#151;but what has he given up?&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Marin&#8217;s mistake, she realized now, had been
letting herself feel superior to Shelly because Shelly was cheesy. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin wasn&#8217;t
jealous of Shelly&#8217;s material success&#151;there was nothing more ritually
aspirational in this day and age than starting a web business&#151;it was Shelly&#8217;s
capacity to surprise, to be the wildcard that no one saw coming, that Marin
envied. To always do exactly what people expected of you&#151;to be the &#147;cool
customer&#148; whose sensibleness and equipoise everyone took for granted&#151;Marin, at
twenty-two, could think of nothing more oppressive than that.</p>

<p class="Story">The jungles of
Borneo were no picnic, let alone a six-figure venture capital deal, but Marin
was still far enough ahead of the curve to know that there are very few moments
in your life when someone will care enough to ask you to do something
completely against your own nature. She just wished that she could know for
certain whether or not she would be betraying herself if she said &#147;yes.&#148;</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2002</h2>
<h3>Ben</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">A</span>ll of Ben&#8217;s pitch
ideas looked stupid typed into a Whatmail instant message chat box. His idea
for a trend piece on the rise of young, hip, trade arts practices in Sausalito
turned into:</p>

<div class="benchat"><%= image_tag "books/o/bens-chat.jpg", alt: "Ben, as Bblake80, chates on WhatMail with Lewisnotclark" %></div>

<p class="Story">MBAD (pronounced &#147;em-bad&#148;) was short for <i>Mission Building Arts + Design</i>. MBAD was a monthly architecture and design arts journal based out of a second-floor loft on 6th
Street between Mission and Howard. MBAD had a decent subscriber base of West
Coast architecture and design firms and design-oriented Bay Area tech
 startups, and despite the recent downturn advertisers
large and small were willing to pay a premium $40 per column inch to
reach the peripheries of the eyeballs of tens of thousands of readers who
believed that there was such a thing as <i>&#147;a better umbrella&#148;</i> (the subject
of a five-hundred-word piece that Ben had written for MBAD last month).</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Lewisnotclark&#148; was
Honor Lewis, MBAD&#8217;s local news editor, a boom-era
transplant from Vermont, via MIT. Honor&#146;s teased
brown curls and love of yoga pants belied her Type A personality. If
Ben pitched story ideas to Honor live, she shot him down nine out of ten
times. However, he&#8217;d discovered a few months ago that if he pitched an idea to
Honor via instant message, she would play devil&#8217;s advocate in the chat, but
when he saw her later around the office, she would more often than not ask him
when he thought he was going to get her a draft of the article that he had just
pitched her. Thus, he suffered the undignified typey-typey and bing-bing
sounds of Whatmail chat, its low-stakes editorial prompts, lazy punctuation, and
typos. </p>

<p class="Story">From Ben&#8217;s
workspace at one of three long communal tables in the middle of the
MBAD loft, he could see inside the editor cubicles lined up against the south
wall, mesh shades rolled up at varying intervals along lengths of glass scaled
for industrial production. Writers, illustrators, editors, and ad and sales
people dressed uniformly in silkscreened T-shirts and jeans or colored cords
milled about busily. MBAD maintained an atypically equitable distribution of
genders and sexual orientations in its staff, and thus was a veritable hothouse
of ill-advised flirtations, assignations, and affairs.</p>

<p class="Story">Most recently and
disturbingly (to Ben, at least), Billy Earhardt, MBAD&#8217;s architecture features
editor, had been sliding green tendrils of attention in Honor Lewis&#8217;s
direction. Billy was a quiescently mordant thirty-year-old (going on sixteen)
who played bass in an awful noise pop band on the weekends. He and Ben
frequently went out for lunch together, Billy knowing all the secret ethnic
holes-in-the-wall to get superior dumplings, noodle soup, and tacos de lengua
on the cheap, and Ben had a bit of a man-crush on him.</p>

<p class="Story">Last week, Billy
had changed Honor&#8217;s screensaver slideshow from photos of whales breaching
(taken by Honor during her March vacation in Catalina Island) to photos of
whale meat kebabs that he had found on the internet. Ben had been amused by
the prank at first, as well as Honor&#8217;s predictable reaction of horror, offense,
and whining. However, then Billy had made a production of confessing outright
and begging Honor for forgiveness. At one point, he&#8217;d called Honor over to his
cubicle and made her look over his shoulder while he placed an online donation
of $200 to Greenpeace <i>&#147;in honor of Honor.&#148; </i>†When even this had not
seemed to appease her, he&#8217;d promised to give up meat for a month. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, please,&#148; Honor
had said, rolling her eyes and going back into her own cubicle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m serious,&#148;
Billy had said. He followed Honor into her cubicle. &#147;You don&#8217;t think that I
could do it? I have, like, insanely good will power.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No bacon, burgers,
fish tacos, eggs, fried chicken, sushi, chorizo&#133;&#148; she&#8217;d said. &#147;No chicken
tikka masala, lamb gyros&#133; are you sure?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sure about me,
but I&#8217;m not sure <i>you&#8217;re</i> going to make it as a vegetarian,&#148; Billy had said. &#147;That was a very long list of repressed foodlusts.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had repressed
the rest of their conversation himself. It was obvious to everyone at MBAD
except Honor that Billy was less interested in Honor&#8217;s repressed desire for
chicken tikka masala than he was in awakening her desire for all things Billy. Billy was not alone in his affections, either. Ben knew that a couple of their
other coworkers (who, however, unlike Billy, had serious girlfriends) found
Honor extremely attractive. Ben supposed that it had something to do with
Honor&#8217;s boobs, which were big. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben was a leg and
ass man himself. He remembered meeting Judith for the first time. While
working on a story for Honor about an ambitious proposition on the upcoming ballot that had sought to greatly expand Healthy San Francisco medical benefits for certain qualifying freelance artists and designers, Ben had been directed
to Judith from his contact at City Hall. Judith had agreed to an interview, and
they&#8217;d met for coffee at the large Peet&#8217;s near Ben&#8217;s other employer, Mud23
Gallery. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had been
expecting a frizzy-haired discount resale pantsuit type. Instead, his
interviewee had been a tall and pretty woman with freckled cheeks whose white
blouse and high-waisted red shorts had revealed four graceful, careful long
brown limbs. The absence of finger jewelry on the slender hands that had cupped
a full mug of chai between expository gestures had genuinely puzzled Ben more
and more as he&#8217;d listened to the hands&#8217; owner entertainingly tell a
human-interest story related to the proposition that also happened to very
subtly service her position. </p>

<p class="Story">When he&#8217;d typed up
his story the following day at MBAD, he&#8217;d actively tried to put some extra spin
or context on Judith&#8217;s story to feel less like a manipulated shmuck. However,
the less editorializing that he did, the better the story worked. He&#8217;d been
truly impressed. When the story had run and Judith called him to thank him,
Ben had taken a chance and asked her to dinner.</p>

<p class="last">That
had been for the August issue. They were wrapping up December and in
pre-production for the January issue now.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Noooooooooooegh&#133;&#148;
came the low moan from Billy&#8217;s cubicle. Ben&#8217;s man-crush stormed into Honor
Lewis&#8217;s cubicle. &#147;Why on earth is the <i>Women&#8217;s Building mural</i> your
favorite work of art?&#148; Billy asked Honor. &#147;For the love of god, <i>why?</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t have to
explain myself,&#148; said Honor.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, you have to
explain why you think that schlocky piece of kitsch is superior to <i>The Dance
Class </i>or <i>Fountain </i>or the<i> </i>Sistine Chapel<i> </i>or about ten
thousand other paintings and sculptures and photographs created over the years,&#148;
he said.</p>

<p class="Story">The Women&#8217;s
Building mural, <i>Maestrapeace</i>, was a mural project painted by a
multicultural collaboration of seven female artists in 1994, to commemorate the
fifteenth anniversary of the beloved community center&#8217;s home on 18th Street. In loud crayon colors, the profiles of eight women had been painted onto the
corners of the outer shell of the building, their hands reaching out to touch
the chins of the women on the opposite corners. At street level, a complex
braid of tapestries and fabric patterns swooped beneath them. Above the main
Women&#8217;s Building entrance stood a three-story portrait of Rigoberta Mench&#250;, the
indigenous Guatemalan woman who&#8217;d won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, water and
nature goddesses springing from her open hands. </p>

<p class="Story">In other words, a
schlocky piece of kitsch.</p>

<p class="Story">Honor picked up her
empty water bottle and stood up with a bounce. She bounced out to the water cooler,
which was a few feet to Ben&#8217;s right, and Billy followed her. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Aliens are
attacking the planet,&#148; Billy said. &#147;You can only save one piece of art in the
entire world. You would save the Women&#8217;s Building mural over Monet&#8217;s
haystacks, Seurat&#8217;s <i>Sunday on La Grande Jatte</i>, Diane Arbus&#8217;s twins?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Honor held her open
bottle under the water spout and pressed the blue button, releasing a thin
column of clear liquid into the plastic bottle with a splatty echo.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I hate Seurat,&#148;
she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben, come on, back
me up here,&#148; said Billy. &#147;The Women&#8217;s Building mural scares my dog when we
walk past it on the weekend. You can&#8217;t have it be your favorite work of art,
Honor. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s insanity.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That this offends
your inbred, art school sensibilities this much&#151;that&#8217;s insanity,&#148; Honor said. She released her finger from the blue button and took a swig of water from her
bottle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Billy&#8217;s not
inbred,&#148; said Ben. &#147;RISD&#8217;s student population is only 75% white, right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Honor laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks Ben,&#148; said
Billy, &#147;thanks a lot.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So that Sausalito
piece,&#148; Honor said to Ben, &#147;I was thinking that maybe I should send Ken down to
Sausalito with you.&#148; Ken was one of the staff photographers. &#147;Maybe do a
shoot&#151;the city kids getting down and dirty in the country type of thing. I&#8217;ll
ask Mike about it when he gets in this afternoon.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mike&#148; was MBAD&#8217;s
managing editor, Michael Rancik.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;That
would be amazing,&#148; said Ben. The only art on Ben&#8217;s pieces so far had been the
occasional archive image. &#147;Thanks, Honor.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">The cloudless
twilight sky over Golden Gate Park was cotton candy pink when Ben locked his
bike and stashed it in the small alcove under the stairs of the porch of
Judith&#8217;s building on Lincoln Way. He came around, climbed the stairs two at a
time, and pressed the second floor buzzer. A few seconds later the front door
unlocked with a familiar scratchy ring. Ben&#8217;s backpack was heavy with jalape&#241;os,
ground beef, grated cheddar, and chicken stock, the missing ingredients for
their dinner that evening of homemade chili and cornbread. Ben slipped his
sandals off onto the colorful braided rug outside the apartment door, which he
then opened without knocking.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith was mixing
yellow and white powder in a metal bowl. She&#8217;d changed to an oversized
sweatshirt and gym shorts, and her hair was pulled up onto the top of her head
in a loose bun. She could have passed undercover at any college dorm in America.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben kissed her <i>hello</i>,
put his backpack on the kitchen table, and unpacked the groceries.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks for going
to the store, babe,&#148; Judith said. &#147;We still have that beer that Phyl and Dave
brought over Friday. It&#8217;s in the fridge.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">That meant she
wanted one. Ben opened the refrigerator. Cold air wafted out. Judith was an
equal opportunity employer of condiments: half-empty bottles and jars of
ketchup, dijon mustard, Sriracha, oyster sauce, salsa verde, cocktail sauce,
and chimichurri and wrinkled foil tubes of anchovy paste, pesto, and wasabi
littered the shelves on the inside of the door. Ben found the beer&#151;a local
organic microbrew&#151;and pulled two bottles out by their necks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I sent our new
interns out to get signatures on the pharm reform petition today,&#148; said
Judith. &#147;They came back with about a dozen signatures each&#151;after <i>six hours</i>
on the street. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. So I had to cancel my meetings for
tomorrow so that I can take them out and show them how to collect. They&#8217;re
your age, but they seem ten years younger.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Interns always
seem young,&#148; Ben said, finding Judith&#8217;s bottle opener in her utensil drawer and
peeling the metal lids off the beer bottles with two small wops. Tiny cirrus
clouds of condensing air floated from their tops. &#147;I think it&#8217;s the word &#8216;intern.&#8217; It strips away all dignity and maturity on contact. Revives long-dormant acne problems.&#148; He set one of the beers down on Judith&#8217;s right-hand
side and drank two long draughts from his own.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How was the
magazine?&#148; Judith asked. She called Mud23 &#147;the gallery&#148; and MBAD &#147;the
magazine.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#8217;m going to Sausalito this weekend to do some interviews for a story. And
they&#8217;re sending a photographer with me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, that&#8217;s
fantastic!&#148; said Judith. &#147;Right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, the
photographer was actually Honor&#8217;s idea,&#148; said Ben, finding a cutting board and
knife. He began to peel and dice the two yellow onions on the counter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess she&#8217;s not
a complete space cadet after all,&#148; said Judith, drinking from her beer and checking
the text of her printed cornbread recipe.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh god,&#148; said
Ben. &#147;Billy and Honor got into this crazy argument this morning.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Judith rolled her
eyes and smirked. &#147;Why don&#8217;t they just do it already?&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Apparently Honor
told him that her favorite work of art is the mural on the Women&#8217;s Building. Which I think she said just because she knew it would piss him off.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Why would that
piss Billy off?&#148; asked Judith. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The Women&#8217;s
Building mural is a little bit over the top, don&#8217;t you think?&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, its
influences are really over the top,&#148; said Judith. &#147;Religious art, folk art,
tribal art. Great traditions which use bright colors and hyperreal images to
tell origin stories and myths which create the foundation for a community&#8217;s
social structure. Of course, it won&#8217;t be cool to tell stories with painting
again until some pasty white guy does it ironically.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fair enough,&#148; said
Ben. &#147;We like ironic painting from pasty Asian women too, though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not Asian women
with tans?&#148; asked Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh no, as soon as
the melanin hits critical mass&#133;&#148; said Ben, &#147;philistines, all of you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m
calling the ACLU,&#148; said Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">They laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">After another hour
and a half, dinner was ready. They ate at the kitchen table, washing down the
warm sweet yellow bread and red stew with two more beers. </p>

<p class="Story">They were slowly
making their way through the DVDs of the first seasons of the premium cable
television drama about the Italian-American mob boss living in a New Jersey
suburb with his wife and two kids. Judith loved it, but Ben thought that it
neither equaled nor surpassed <i>The Godfather</i> and didn&#8217;t see what all the
fuss was about. </p>

<p class="Story">They watched two
episodes of this. </p>

<p class="Story">As the credits
rolled at the end of the second episode, Judith moved the hand that had been
resting on Ben&#8217;s knee slowly up his thigh and kissed him once on the mouth. In
what seemed to Ben in his
post-beer/post-comfort-food/post-premium-entertainment haze a single gesture,
Judith pulled off her sweatshirt and let down her hair. Their second kiss was
longer, an extended exchange of data designed to crack the system open. The
credits finished, the DVD player audibly switched modes several times in a row
and then went silent. The TV screen went blue. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith was on her
back on the couch in just her underwear now. After a few more minutes of
teasing, those last pieces of bourgeois detritus would be on the floor.</p>

<p class="Story">In just
five months of dating, Judith and Ben had eliminated the need for word-based
communication during foreplay and sex. Through touch and half-finished
syllables alone, they could tell each other what they wanted, thus sustaining
the incredibly exciting illusion that each could anticipate the other's needs. This, Ben had learned, was the key to great sex on a regular basis.</p>

<p class="Story">They lingered for a
minute on the couch together afterward, but soon Judith was up and away into
the bathroom. Ben heard her brushing her teeth when he finally sat up and put
his briefs back on. He placed his right palm on the middle of his chest. Under
a small, thin patch of hair, there was a bright, hard surface that felt
powerful and young. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith was the
first woman that Ben had ever been with who didn&#8217;t need him to assuage some
interminable existential well of something or other that opened up after sex. He was free to linger after their liaisons in blithe nothingness before
returning, guilt-free, to a world of independent inclination and endeavor. At
first, Ben hadn&#8217;t been sure that Judith&#8217;s mien of post-coital autonomy was not
some savvy adaptation to the harsher realities of urban dating. However,
Judith&#8217;s repeated assurances that this was the way that she had always been,
along with her consistency in the ensuing months, had convinced him.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith was in her
bedroom opening and snapping shut her glasses case now. Ben folded his shirt
and jeans and placed them on the middle seat of the couch. He went into the
bedroom. Judith, in her pajama shorts and shirt and glasses, was slipping
under the covers of her queen bed with the Leslie Marmon Silko novel that she
was reading. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben went to the
other side of the bed, propped a pillow up next to Judith, and picked up that
week&#8217;s issue of <i>The New Yorker</i> from the bedside table where he&#8217;d left it
two nights ago. He climbed into bed and began reading a three-page The Art
World article.  The article was about an installation artist and the artist&#146;s recent piece, which consisted
entirely of dark, empty rooms that visitors walked around carrying blue pen
flashlights. </p>

<p class="last">Ben
reconsidered the Women&#8217;s Building mural&#8217;s aesthetics in the light of Judith&#8217;s
comments earlier that evening. Was it really not a terrible piece of work? Ben tended to question the motivations of apologists for bad taste, but there
was something persuasive and prophetic about Judith&#8217;s &#147;pasty white guy&#148; crack. </p>

<p class="first">Late the next morning
at the gallery, Ben had a free hour or so waiting for his coworker Angela to
finish with the laser printer before he could print his address labels for the
pre-show mailer. Still thinking about the Women&#8217;s Building, he went into the workroom,
closed the door, and pulled a bunch of slides from the archives of the original
Mud23 Gallery, which had been located at 2300 Alabama Street during the tail
end of the eighties and the early nineties. Ben plugged in the lightbox and
lined the slides up on the glowing white surface. Six of these had &#147;FLINT #-&#148;
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 written on the bottom in black permanent marker. </p>

<p class="Story">FLINT was Rocco
Morris&#8217;s graffiti name and tag. It was also the tongue-in-cheek name of a
cartoon match man that Rocco had been spray-painting all over the city for
years. The wooden stick-body of the match man was painted in three-dimensional
perspective, curving and twisting out of the plane of the wall, and the flaming
head bore big cartoon eyes and a wicked cartoon smile.</p>

<p class="Story">Most of the labeled
FLINT slides showed original pieces, &#147;thrown up&#148; (as per street art lingo) by
the artist directly onto Mud23 walls just for that show, but &#147;FLINT #-7&#148; showed
a garage door that had been removed from whatever garage it had secured and
transplanted to the gallery for the show. It was spray-painted over with a
black-and-white FLINT tag and (in color) a version of Rocco&#8217;s match character
holding a taco and breathing fire. Looking at it made Ben crave hard shell
tacos&#151;he was already six dollars over-budget for the week and had skipped
breakfast.</p>

<p class="Story">Someone had dated
the garage door slide on its corner in ballpoint pen: &#147;8-2-91.&#148; In 1991, Rocco
had been only a few years older than Ben was now, and yet Rocco&#8217;s voice and
vision had already been so clear. Maybe it took years of hindsight and the
imprimatur of Venice to see the authenticity in the work of Rocco Morris and
his cohort, but Ben felt strongly that that wasn&#8217;t all. Rocco, Mud23&#8217;s owner
Phillip Mudke, Judith: all from the generation before Ben&#8217;s; none with a
typical career path. However, each of them had still laid the groundwork for
their current vocations very early on. Ben just didn't see that kind of focus
and determination in even the most brilliant and promising members of his own
generation.</p>

<p class="Story">There was a knock
on the door.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Come in!&#148; said
Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">The door opened a
crack, and Ben&#8217;s boss Phillip peeked his head into the room.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Benjamin, we&#8217;re
ordering from that Cuban place on 3rd&#151;do you want anything?&#148; he asked. &#147;My
treat.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, sure&#133; a Cuban
sandwich and caf&#233; con leche would be great,&#148; said Ben. &#147;Thanks Phillip!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are you
looking at on the lightbox?&#148; Phillip asked. He walked into the room, bent over
the lightbox, and squinted at the slides. &#147;<i>Oof</i>, those are all pretty
old.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;FLINT was one of
the street artists that exhibited at the Venice Biennale Arsenale last year,
right?&#148; asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">Phillip picked up
the slide labeled &#147;FLINT #-6&#148; and held it up to the faint yellow light of the
naked bulb on the ceiling. &#147;FLINT, a.k.a. Rocco Morris, and I go way back. He
has some pieces at the Yerba Buena show right now.&#148; Phillip put &#147;FLINT #-6&#148; back
on the lightbox.</p>

<p class="Story">He recognized one of the other slides on the box and
laughed. He picked up the offending slide&#151;a stencil painting of Oliver North
(modeled after North&#8217;s mug shot photo) over the caption:</p>

<div class="stencil"><%= image_tag "books/o/stencil.png", alt: "A WRONG CON TRA(GEDY)" %></div>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is that an old
friend too?&#148; asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A very
embarrassing old friend who went legit a long time ago,&#148; said Phillip. &#147;Boy, I
loved my stencils in those days. I thought there was something very poetic,
very post-industrial about mass-producing an image over and over again with a
can of spray paint and a stencil.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ah, my na&#239;ve
younger days as an itinerant vandal,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know you&#8217;re
being sarcastic, but you&#8217;re right, there was some innocence to what we did in
those days. In the nineties, you had spray can artists working with muralistas
on Balmy Alley and Clarion Alley; art school stars painting side-by-side with
high school dropouts. There were always little kids running around helping
with the murals. We got small grants every so often for materials, but no one
did it for money. Secretly, we all were just hungry to be part of something
big and beautiful, even the taggers, sneaking around in their hoodies in the
middle of the night.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben&#8217;s stomach
grumbled. &#147;So why is Rocco at DAEMON Gallery now?&#148; he asked, referring to the
bigshot New York gallery that Rocco Morris had left Mud23 for one year ago.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The thing about
Rocco is that he has a lot of authenticity anxiety,&#148; said Phillip. &#147;It&#8217;s very
important to him to continue making art on the streets that involves a certain
level of difficulty and personal endangerment. And he wants to keep that
separate from what he sees as the necessary evil of gallery work. If Rocco was
still at Mud23, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to give him the same amount of space that
DAEMON gives him. I, as his friend, want him to stop taking certain risks on
the street, and that gets tainted and confused if we have this other, business,
relationship. DAEMON Gallery, on the other hand, just loves that FLINT&#8217;s still
tagging abandoned parking garages in West Oakland. Rocco can do one big show
at DAEMON Gallery, take home a decent living, and spend the rest of the year
pretending he&#8217;s still the same old punk kid poking fun at The Man.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben noticed the
note of self-righteousness in Phillip&#8217;s voice&#151;the kind that comes from knowing
someone before they&#8217;ve become famous. In the art world, being on the right
side of history&#151;before history became history&#151;was everything. <i>Only now</i>,
Ben thought, <i>the window of opportunity for discovering new talent is smaller
than it&#8217;s ever been.</i> These days, anything remotely underground and
alternative seemed to turn into a clich&#233; overnight. But only someone involved
in the business side of art could mourn the increased ease for artists to find
their way into the mainstream.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good for him,&#148; Ben
said instead, and meant it. &#147;Somewhere out there is some teenager
spray-painting his skateboard&#133; who needs FLINT to still be FLINT.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You should meet
Rocco sometime,&#148; said Phillip, turning to leave. He paused at the door. &#147;He
has his own perspective on these things. Although he&#8217;s always been much more
excited about success when it&#8217;s not his own,&#148; Phillip said. &#147;Cuban sandwich
and caf&#233; con leche, right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben nodded. &#147;And I
could split an order of fries, too,&#148; he said. He didn&#8217;t want to take
advantage, but he really was very hungry.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">&#147;T</span>he Sirens were bird-women: grotesque
creatures.  However, their destructiveness lay not in any physical threat
or power, but in loosening people&#8217;s own internal voices of temptation with
their song,&#148; said Phillip Mudke, the director and owner of Mud23 Gallery and
Ben&#8217;s boss.</p>

<p class="Story">Phillip was
introducing Mud23&#8217;s new show to a crowd of approximately forty-five people. 
The show, &#147;Sci-rens,&#148; was a series of colorful and detailed
underground-comix-style ink drawings, each of an everyday person tied with rope
to a wooden mast and trying desperately to escape his or her restraints to
various contemporary temptations of sorts: the bounty of a Walmart-like
discount store; a California sunset over a stretch of I-280 packed
bumper-to-bumper with SUVs; a caf&#233; full of customers with identical laptops
sipping identical lattes out of identical mugs; a group of teenagers on a couch
binging on junk food, beer, and marijuana, eyes entranced by the glowing TV in
front of them; etc.  </p>

<p class="Story">The drawings&#8217;
creator, Serene Johnson, was standing by Phillip, the white tips of her yellow
Converse sneakers pointed together.</p>

<p class="Story">He continued: &#147;The
Sirens were destroyed when someone, Odysseus, heard their song and did not
go to them.  His crew plugged their ears with wax, but Odysseus, wanting
to hear what the Sirens&#8217; deadly song sounded like, asked his crew to leave his
ears unplugged and tie him to the mast as his ship passed the Sirens&#8217; island.&#148; </p>

<p class="last">Marin had come to
the &#147;Sci-rens&#148; opening with Ben, Judith, and Jorge purely in a spectator
capacity. &#147;Sci-rens&#148; had sold out completely a month ago, to a number of
private collectors that Mud23 worked with regularly.  Ben had assured
Marin that the drawings were too &#147;jokey&#148; to have real long-term investment
value.  However, as soon as she&#8217;d seen the traffic jam drawing she&#8217;d felt
a little cheated.  </p>

<p class="first">Phillip wrapped up his remarks, and people
resumed their conversations.  </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So is this super
cathartic for you?&#148; Jorge asked Ben.  &#147;You&#8217;ve been working really hard
this past month.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A little bit,&#148; he
said.  &#147;I&#8217;m just amazed that it all came together&#151;things are always by the
seat of one&#8217;s pants at Mud23.  Honestly, I&#8217;ve spent the past fifteen
minutes thinking about all the things I can finally take care of tomorrow now
that this is over.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Welcome to the
world of work, babe,&#148; Judith said.  &#147;It&#8217;s all one big process now. 
In school, you pull your all-nighter, take your final, and party,
but in the real world the job is never done.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Which I&#8217;m kind of
glad about,&#148; said Ben.  &#147;Life would get pretty boring pretty
quickly if it was any other way, don&#8217;t you think?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Benjamin,&#148; said
Phillip, standing at the edge of their group with a young man in his late twenties.  </p>

<p class="Story">Dressed in a
rigorously ordinary outfit of white T-shirt and mall-bought jeans, Phillip&#8217;s
friend had wavy dark brown hair, a scratch of facial hair, and chapped sealskin
lips.  He seemed like the kind of person who ordinarily wouldn&#8217;t be caught
dead in this scene.  </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I want you to meet
someone,&#148; Phillip said to Ben.  &#147;This is Charlie Cohen.  He&#8217;s a good
friend of Marcus Holland.  Charlie, this is Benjamin Blakeman.  Ben
writes for MBAD when he&#8217;s not at Mud23.&#148;  </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey man, good to
meet you,&#148; said Charlie.  </p>

<p class="Story">The two young men
shook hands.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m going to see
if Angela needs anything.  Enjoy the show, everyone,&#148; said Phillip.</p>

<p class="Story">He left.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You work for MBAD,
the design magazine?&#148; Charlie asked Ben. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Does this chick
named Honor Lewis still work there?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, she&#8217;s our
editor of local news,&#148; said Ben.  &#147;How do you know Honor?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We were the same
year at MIT.  We worked on the school paper together,&#148; said Charlie. 
He smirked. &#147;She hates me, though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really?&#148; said
Ben.  &#147;Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sure she
doesn&#8217;t give a shit about me anymore,&#148; said Charlie, &#147;but we were the top two
candidates for editor-in-chief of <i>The Tech </i>at the end of junior year,
and <i>moi</i> got the job.  Hence the animosity.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s lame,&#148; said
Ben.  &#147;People really like her at MBAD, but I don&#8217;t know&#133; I keep waiting
for her to grow on me, but it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey babe,&#148; Judith
said to Ben, &#147;I think Rocco&#8217;s here.  She indicated with a turn of her
head a skinny black-haired man in the corner wearing a worn navy blue hoodie
and talking to Serene Johnson.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh good,&#148; said
Ben.  &#147;Phillip said that Rocco wanted to talk to me about something
tonight,&#148; he explained to the non-Judith members of the group.  He turned
to Charlie and said, &#147;I have to go take care of this work thing, but good to
meet you, man.  You&#8217;ll have to give me some good Honor Lewis blackmail
stories sometime.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That I can do,&#148;
said Charlie.  </p>

<p class="Story">Ben left.  </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So how do you guys
know Ben?&#148; Charlie asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, Ben, and I were
all good friends in college,&#148; said Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And Ben is my
fianc&#233;,&#148; Judith added.  &#147;How do you know Phillip, exactly?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My family friend
Marcus is a big collector of <i>the art</i>, and I met Phillip at one of
Marcus&#8217;s parties in Napa last year,&#148; said Charlie. &#147;Phillip&#8217;s a cool guy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I&#8217;m going
to peruse the show one more time, anyone else up for it?&#148; said Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll peruse with
you,&#148; said Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Speaking of Napa,
I think I should refill my wine cup first,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wine sounds good
to me,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith and Jorge
linked arms and walked away towards a drawing in the corner, and Marin headed
with Charlie towards the white reception counter on which sat ten bottles of
2004 California chardonnay. Charlie grabbed the neck of an open bottle and
motioned for Marin to hand him her empty cup. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s a pretty
bloodless show, for a show about temptation,&#148; he said, as he filled Marin&#8217;s cup
to within a quarter-inch of the rim.  &#147;Don&#8217;t you think?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s because
it&#8217;s difficult to universalize temptation,&#148; said Marin.  &#147;One woman&#8217;s
temptation is another&#8217;s soporific.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And yet one&#8217;s
temptations seem to find you, no matter where you hide,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you need to be
tied to a mast?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That depends on
who&#8217;s doing the tying,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That would be a
shipful of Greek sailors,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think that&#8217;s
more your friend Jorge&#8217;s cup of tea, not mine,&#148; said Charlie.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t
be <i>immune to the opportunity</i> to board that ship, either,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I bet you
wouldn&#8217;t,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are we even
talking about again?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What do you want
to be talking about?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Global warming;
religion and the Russian consciousness; papier m&#226;ch&#233;: weird kiddie craft or
under-tapped creative medium?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, breathe,&#148;
said Charlie.  &#147;How about: what do you do for a living?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;I&#8217;m a
data/information specialist at the Pac Development Bank,&#148; she said.  &#147;And
you?&#148;</p>

<p class="first">He was a blogger. Marin wasn&#8217;t sure what
that meant, except that it possibly involved posting too much information about
one&#8217;s self on the internet. She had no idea how such a silly-sounding word had
been created, overcome the objections of all civilized people with a say in
such matters to become the accepted term of art for whatever it was that
bloggers did, and become an actual profession that ostensibly sane people
ascribed to themselves at parties&#151;all while she was in Borneo.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How do you feel
about numbers?&#148; asked Charlie. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;They&#8217;re nice,&#148;
said Marin, &#147;I like big ones in my bank account. Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have this theory
that most people can be divided into two groups: people who trust numbers more
than they should, and people who have an irrational distrust of numbers. The
former, ironically, are generally the more cynical group. They distrust almost
everything else in the world&#151;politicians, corporations, food service
workers&#151;but they trust statistics, even ones they have no context for or don&#8217;t
even understand the math behind.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And the latter?&#148;
asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, they&#8217;re just
more self-aware about their own math skills. They trust what they can see and
judge for themselves, which is a great way to live if you&#8217;re built that way and
a little bit stupid. My blog, <i>Bigsigma</i>, is about statistics&#133; written as
if it was for the stupid trusty people, but it&#8217;s really for the cynical people
who like numbers but don&#8217;t understand them.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That actually
makes sense,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Good</i>,&#148; said
Charlie, somehow making the word sound like a new epithet. &#147;I&#8217;m here because I
wanted to pick Phillip&#8217;s brain about some things. I&#8217;m trying to come up with a
model for predicting final sale prices of contemporary art at Christie&#8217;s and
Sotheby&#8217;s.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really?&#148; said
Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s actually
turning out to be much more simple than I thought it would be,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#8217;m
surprised that nobody&#8217;s ever done it before. The auction houses set their
numbers down beforehand based on intuition, experience, and things like
absentee bids, but nobody&#8217;s ever tried to simulate the stochastic system
before.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin nodded,
interested but suspicious. It still spooked her when she met someone whose
path seemed too fortuitously dovetailed with hers, although she was beginning
to understand that the university that she had attended had been her
orientation into a very specific class of contemporary society and that such
fortuitous dovetailing was the logical outcome of being an active member of
this class. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what&#8217;s up with
Ben and Mrs. Robinson?&#148; Charlie asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;They&#8217;re engaged,&#148;
said Marin. &#147;It&#8217;s a thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Does Ben have
unresolved mommy issues or something?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Oy,</i>&#148; said
Marin. &#147;No. There are no issues whatsoever involved here. They&#8217;re in love. The stochastic system of one plus one equals happily ever after.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, bully for
them,&#148; Charlie said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you know why I
said that your blog strategy makes sense?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m guessing that
you&#8217;re not going to say: <i>&#8216;because you&#8217;re really fucking brilliant?&#8217;</i>&#148;
said Charlie.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because it allows
you to speak condescendingly to people who otherwise would take offense,&#148; said
Marin.</p>

<p class="last">Charlie laughed: a
large, rippling laugh, like a bunch of parabolas stacked on top of each other. &#147;You actually kind of get me,&#148; he said. &#147;I like you.&#148; He took out his
cellphone. &#147;You wouldn&#8217;t want to give me your number, by any chance, would
you?&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Ben had a lead. Someone had sent Rocco
Morris a mysterious postcard, which Rocco (knowing that Ben was searching for
new artists in Rocco&#8217;s mold) had brought with him to the &#147;Sci-rens&#148; opening to
show Ben. Manually laminated with clear packing tape onto its front was a
photograph of a painting: a brightly-colored, crudely-drawn, muralismo-style
oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a spring of water gushing forth from
her hands and displaying&#151;of all things&#151;a photorealist rendering of a plastic
bottle of Vilreda, an antiretroviral drug. The painting wasn&#8217;t beautiful, but
it was made from bigger things than beauty: glory, anonymous suffering, the
clean and crass miracle of capitalism. </p>

<p class="Story">Handwritten on the
back of the postcard in a narrow, impish scrawl was the following message: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="first"><i>The mother without
a home paints on the streets. The son without a mother rents his time on earth
with pharmaceutical love. FLINT shows us the way to our true selves. </i></p>

<p class="Epigraph2"><i>-GXG, 2004.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story">No name, no
address.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, I love
it,&#148; said Marin, holding the postcard out at arm&#8217;s length, image-side-up on her
open palm. &#147;I can&#8217;t believe how much I love it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin&#133;&#148; said Ben. &#147;Isn&#8217;t Vilreda a Fenniskrante drug?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">It was, but Marin
didn&#8217;t answer him. She just stared at the postcard. In fact, Fenniskrante had
acquired the world&#8217;s leading developer of HIV medications two years ago and,
with it, Vilreda.</p>

<p class="Story">The &#147;Sci-Rens&#148;
opening had ended a little while ago. Marin and Ben were alone in the gallery
with a few of Ben&#8217;s coworkers, who were cleaning up. Charlie and Jorge had
both left around nine, and Judith had left about twenty minutes after that.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had given
Charlie her number, but only because she didn&#8217;t expect him to call her. </p>

<p class="Story">She handed Ben back
the postcard.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Phillip hasn&#8217;t
seen this yet,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Rocco thinks that it&#8217;ll be better if I check things
out with him first. There&#8217;s no address, just a cryptic message signed with
initials: obviously, this artist is very reclusive.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How are you going
to find this guy&#151;GXG?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Rocco remembers
seeing an unusual tag in Bayview-Hunters Point a month ago. He thinks that it
may have been signed GXG. It was a drawing of a pile of pills.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Marin didn&#8217;t ask
any more questions. Her role in all of this consisted of one thing only:
writing a check at the exact right time. </p>

<p class="first">The moon was almost full. Only its upper
left edge was cast in shadow: a lily pad tipped an inch into the muddy water.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin was renting a
one-bedroom in the Mission in a three-story building next door to an occult
bookstore called Coven Press. During the day, black-lipped Wicca shopgirls and
shopboys stood outside the bookstore smoking clove cigarettes. Once, a skinny
shopboy had stopped Marin on her walk home from work and told her that he liked
her tattoo. He&#8217;d had on a black leather choker with a silver pentagram
pendant, and his fingernails had been painted black with white crosses. He
couldn&#8217;t have been older than twenty.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The crow is a
scavenger,&#148; he&#8217;d said, &#147;a mediator between the worlds of life and death.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A scaviator,&#148; Marin had said.</p>

<p class="Story">The kid had smiled and said, &#147;<i>Sic transit
gloria mundi</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Thus passes the
glory of the world</i>. </p>

<p class="Story">Now the bookstore
was closed for the night. Dark and empty, a metal gate was drawn down over
the front door. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin felt the
muffled tug of a sulfite-induced headache coming on as she unlocked the front
door to her building. She got her mail&#151;her cable bill and a five-by-seven-inch
postcard mailer about Proposition 71, a bill up for vote in November that
explicitly made stem cell research a constitutional right and also allocated
California municipal bond money for stem cell research.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin climbed the
stairs to her floor and unlocked her apartment door. She switched on lights,
kicked off shoes, grabbed the gigantic bottle of ibuprofen from her drug stash,
and sat down on the edge of her living room couch. She twisted off the cap of
the ibuprofen, rattled two burgundy-colored pills out onto her palm, worked up
a teaspoon of saliva onto her tongue, popped the pills into her mouth, and
swallowed. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi</i>, she thought. The Coven Press kid
had either been making fun of her or he&#8217;d really thought that she was a badass: Marin didn&#8217;t know which was more sad.</p>

<p class="Story">She looked at the
front of the Prop 71 postcard: it was a dark, rich blue. A blue of law
enforcement uniforms, truth, and the sea. Prop 71 was everywhere now, but easy
to ignore, because Marin knew where she stood (pro). Judith&#8217;s bill, on the
other hand, 66A, was also ubiquitous, but much more annoyingly so. </p>

<p class="Story">BAARC&#8217;s &#147;YES on
66A&#148; campaign had, to date, consisted primarily of recounting anecdotes primed
to generate a reaction of kneejerk disgust towards Marin&#8217;s father&#8217;s profession.
†BAARC had recalled such gems as: the Big Pharma sales manager who&#8217;d given his
reps reading glasses to wear to boost their credibility with doctors (while his
company&#8217;s recruiters had ignored entry-level sales applicants with 4.0 GPAs
because they weren&#8217;t attractive enough); the oral contraceptive rep who&#8217;d
started a fictitious rumor that a Modesto gynecologist had been sued for
malpractice by his pregnant fourteen-year-old patient&#8217;s parents for not
initiating a discussion with their daughter about birth control; and the 2000
study that showed that the more time that doctors spend with pharmaceutical
sales reps, the more frequently they prescribe drugs against their patients&#8217; best
interests. </p>

<p class="Story">In response, the
drug companies had banded together to roll out an expensive &#147;NO on 66A&#148;
campaign that made the bill sound like the second coming of Adolf Hitler. One
&#147;NO on 66A&#148; television spot showed beakers being filled with viscous liquid by
latex-covered hands in a clean and modern laboratory as upbeat music played and
a gravitas-laden earth mother voice began to narrate: <i>&#147;America&#8217;s top
scientists are hard at work: on a cure for breast cancer, on groundbreaking
treatments for multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia, on ways to extend the lives
of children born with cystic fibrosis. A group of San Francisco radicals&#151;&#148;</i> The video cut to a grainy black-and-white clip of some activists protesting the
Iraq War as the soundtrack switched to a series of spare and foreboding music
cues. <i>&#147;&#151;wants California doctors to be left out of the loop. If
Proposition 66A passes in November, information about new medications will have
to go through an elaborate bureaucracy&#151;&#148; </i>†The video cut to a mail cart
filled with files being rolled through an endless aisle flanked with shelves
filled floor to ceiling with more files. <i>&#147;&#151;before your doctor can get you
and your children the treatments you need. Vote &#8216;no&#8217; on 66A in November, and
vote &#8216;yes&#8217; on the future.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Putting aside the
very real danger that a successful Prop 66A in California could lead to a similar
state law being passed in Illinois, which could put her father out of work,
Marin thought that Judith and BAARC had missed an opportunity to initiate an
authentic discussion about medications and money, the commodification of the
health industry, and the paradoxes underlying pharmaceutical advertising in
general. Probably because this was a discussion that not even BAARC was ready
to have.</p>

<p class="Story">GXG, on the other
hand, was a proposition that all parties could get behind. Even Walter
&#147;museums are capitalism&#8217;s rounding error&#148; Choo could love an artist whose
inadvertent message was &#147;Big Pharma is the new God,&#148; and Judith was not in this
lifetime going to question the subversive credentials of an angry HIV-positive
street punk with a homeless mother.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin changed into
her sleep sweats and brushed her teeth. Her electric toothbrush&#8217;s tiny buzzing
motor was a fly caught in a window screen. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin was aware of
how quickly the heretofore unwanted decision-making wild cards of love and gut
feeling had been shuffled into the deck. However, maybe she&#8217;d had it wrong all
along. Like in Serene Johnson&#8217;s drawings, maybe the true face of temptation in
this day and age wasn&#8217;t falling in love with a new project or taking a leap of
faith on the unknown, maybe it was the seductive pull of security and status
quo. Maybe this&#151;helping GXG get his start&#151;was what the money had been for all
along. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin washed her
face and patted it dry with a towel. Her bathroom mirror reflected back the
face of a pretty woman with pink lips, crabapple cheekbones, and pooling almond
eyes. No wonder she&#8217;d been such an obnoxious know-it-all, looking like that. She hadn&#8217;t known anything yet at all.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin turned off
the bathroom and living room lights, and went into her bedroom and shut the
door behind herself. She lifted the corner of her comforter and slipped
herself under it and into bed. She closed her eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s father was
always trying to manipulate his sleep schedule: coffee in the morning, tea or
energy drinks in the afternoon, beer at dinner, and melatonin, antihistamines,
or sleeping pills around ten. Walter spent ten dollars or more a day to make
his body exhibit the diurnal circadian rhythms that all human beings are
biologically predisposed to. It was rare to find such redundancy in her father&#146;s daily life, but if Walter Choo stopped
pumping chemicals into his body for five minutes he might see how profoundly
depressed he was, and the world couldn&#8217;t have that. </p>

<p class="Story">All of the San
Francisco night noises that Marin usually found quaint next to the din of
cicadas that had flooded the jungle each night at the O/URC&#151;the J-train
rattling down its track a block away, cars powering up the hill outside Marin&#8217;s
building, a homeless man rattling a bag of aluminum cans behind him&#151;seemed
unbearably loud tonight.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin got out of
bed, went into the living room, switched on a small lamp on her desk, and
booted up the laptop next to it. The laptop switched on with a
rectangle-shaped flash of white, which disappeared onto a photo of the
orangutan Gia eating a piece of yellow-green durian fruit. The photo was a
rare souvenir from Marin&#8217;s months at the O/URC.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin clicked on
the web browser icon and, in the address bar at the top of the window that
opened, typed in the address of her preferred search website. She did an
internet search for <i>&#147;HIV positive artist.&#148;</i> </p>

<p class="Story">The opposite of
insomnia in 2004 was not sleep but the internet search. Ancient Rome, the
British empire circa 1830, Stalinist Russia&#151;none of the juiced-up leaders of
these mega-states had tasted power like the algorithm-enabled internet search
in their lifetimes. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin clicked on a
few of the links that her search had brought up, and her consciousness
swallowed the information that she found there in huge chunks. After clicking
on the fifth most-promising link and scanning the website that opened for
something that would make her feel what GXG&#8217;s postcard had made her feel&#151;to no
avail&#151;the exposed surfaces of her eyeballs felt gluey and loamed.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin typed <i>&#147;bigsigma.com&#148;</i>
into the browser address bar and hit the return key. A scab-red background
filled the window, with the sideways M&#8217;s of oversized capital sigma letters
placed at staggered intervals in a slightly brighter, whiter shade of red. The
header was a rollover image: &#147;BIG SIGMA&#148; spelled in stylish violet-red
letters outlined in black. The tag line <i>&#147;fuzzy math for the rest of us&#148;</i>
was written just underneath the blog&#8217;s name in black in a smaller font. </p>
<p class="Story">This
  wasn&#8217;t an online diary. This was a magazine. </p>

<p class="Story">The most recent
post was Charlie&#8217;s final sale predictions for a high-profile contemporary art
auction to be held in London in a week. Marin skimmed it and clicked on the
link &#147;About Charlie&#148; on the sidebar. An enormous red capital sigma letter
appeared and washed the screen from right to left, and a short bio of Charlie appeared
in its wake:</p>

<p class="Story">Marin did not dislike cleverness, but she did associate its excitements with being young.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin cleared her
internet history and shut down her computer.</p>

<p class="Story">She knew too many
things, too many weird things. You did all you could in order to try to feel
something special, something extraordinary, and then once you did all you
wanted to do was feel normal again. </p>

<p class="first">Two days later, Rocco found him. &#147;GXG&#148; was
Gilbert Xavier Garcia, a high school dropout living in
Bayview-Hunters Point and working as a bike messenger. He was gay and
HIV-positive. He had no idea who his father was, and his mother had gone
insane and disappeared into the dissociated ranks of the Bay Area homeless
community when Garcia was nineteen. </p>

<p class="Story">Rocco had found the
tag signed &#147;GXG&#148; where he&#8217;d remembered seeing it. Rocco had identified by
sight the color and brand of spray paint that had been used and knew the owner
of a nearby shop that sold that kind of paint. The shop owner remembered
selling this kind of paint to a new, older kid with three initials (quite
possibly GXG) tattooed on the back of his hand and advised Rocco to ask at the
skate shop next door. The skate shop had a Gil Garcia on their email mailing
list and gave Rocco this Gil Garcia&#8217;s email address.</p>

<p class="Story">Rocco quickly
struck up an email relationship with Garcia, established that Garcia was the
creator and sender of the Vilreda postcard, thanked him for it, and found out a
little bit more about him. On his fourth or fifth email Rocco mentioned that
someone at Mud23 was interested in seeing Garcia&#8217;s art. Three days went by
with no response from GXG. Then, finally, Rocco received the following, which
he forwarded to Ben and which Ben forwarded to Marin:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">From:
Gil Garcia &lt;gxgarcia@voodoo.com&gt;</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">hi rocco,</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">i am happy to hear that some Gallery people
are interested in my paintinG. however, i am very cautious because all of my
paintinG is very personal to me and i&#8217;m not sure that someone workinG in a
Gallery will really understand where it comes from and what it means.</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">i have decided that i can meet with up to
two people from this Gallery under the followinG terms:</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">i)
no photoGraphs or video of me or my work</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">ii)
we will meet at zeliG bar in the mission and then, if the meetinG Goes well, we
will taXi to my house to look at my paintinGs</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">iii)
no questions about my family, my childhood, or my medical condition</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">iv)
they must address me as &#147;mr. Garcia&#148;</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">v) there will be no interaction with any of

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">peace,
love, rock salt,</p>

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:0">-GXG</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">After forwarding
her the email, Ben called Marin at work. </p>
<p class="Story">&#147;So,&#148; he said, &#147;what do you think?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Joon and Kendra
were out to lunch so Marin was alone in the lab with the boys. Sergey had
brought a homemade lunch&#151;roast chicken and green beans with rice in a square
plastic tupperware&#151;and eaten it at his desk, and now the lab smelled like a cart
of airplane meals: the once separate salt, meat, grain, and greens smells
steamed together to form an all-purpose food smell that made Marin want to skip
her own lunch entirely.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess this kind
of quirkiness comes with the territory, right?&#148; she said to Ben. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sanity is usually
not a quality that artists maintain in bulk supply, no,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; she said. &#147;Let&#8217;s do this. I&#8217;m free this Saturday.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll email him
back and &#8216;bcc&#8217; you,&#148; he said. &#147;What time, like, two, three?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Works for me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know, this
could end up being really disappointing,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know,&#148; said
Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben emailed &#147;Mr.
Garcia,&#148; copying Rocco, blind-copying Marin, agreeing to the artist&#8217;s terms,
and suggesting Saturday, June 19, at two p.m. to meet. Garcia emailed back a
few minutes later, saying that he couldn&#8217;t make it until six p.m. Ben
forwarded Marin the email and asked if six worked for her (it did). He replied
to Garcia confirming the same. Marin signed out and closed her Whatmail window
just as Joon and Kendra came back from lunch. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know what I
mean, right?&#148; Kendra said to Joon as they sat down at their desks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course, my
dear,&#148; said Joon. &#147;You know, and I know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s why I love
you,&#148; said Kendra.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had known
hermetic sororities of two like Kendra and Joon since grade school, but she had
been surprised to find one at Pac. Alliances of a non-Machiavellian variety
were rare at Pac, and the Kendra-Joon friendship, although holding some utility
within the five-person world of their lab, was predicated on neither girl
outperforming the other by any substantial measure. At the same time, perhaps
Marin was underestimating the net value of having someone to have lunch with
every day.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">On Friday night, Marin thought several
times about calling Charlie and canceling (at the last minute) their first
date. She had forgotten that she had already agreed (via text message) to meet
Charlie for dinner after work on Friday when she&#8217;d told Ben that Saturday was a
good time to meet GXG. The two appointments weren&#8217;t, in the strictest sense,
in conflict with each other, but Marin felt as if they were.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie had picked
an Indian restaurant in Pacific Heights called East India Company; Marin took
the 22-Fillmore bus there. At the post-work hour of seven-fifteen, Marin&#8217;s
neighborhood had been full of people her age starting their weekends with drink
specials and feisty group dinners. Absolutely none of them were headed to
Pacific Heights, not on the 22-Fillmore anyway.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin saw an
unmarked Irish pub and a closed flower shop where the restaurant should have
been and for a moment Marin thought that she had misread Charlie&#8217;s text. On
second glance, the &#147;pub&#148; had a small, unpainted wooden sign hanging over the
entryway with the initials &#147;E.I.C.&#148; carved into one side. The exes and cross
of the Union Jack were carved into the other side. </p>

<p class="Story">Framed
reproductions of pages from the original charter of the East India Company
lined the front hallway, along with white votive candles on tiny mahogany
ledges. Marin smelled spices, freshly-toasted papadum crackers, and peanut
oil. There was no one manning the host&#8217;s station in front, but Marin spotted
Charlie at a table for two at the long be-pillowed booth along the far wall and
made her way to him. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fancy meeting you
here,&#148; said Charlie. He stood up and reached over the table to kiss Marin on
the cheek. &#147;You look great. I really like your tattoo, by the way.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks,&#148; said
Marin. They sat down. &#147;You don&#8217;t have any tattoos, do you?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m an MIT math
nerd,&#148; said Charlie. &#147;The only body art I&#8217;ve ever sported is newsprint stains
and the occasional paper cut.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed, but
sensed posturing, not self-effacement, behind his joke. They both looked down
and opened their menus. There was the standard mix of curries and
accompaniments, wine, beer, and the now-requisite list of $9 specialty
cocktails on the last page. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The saag paneer is
really good here,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;Their garlic naan is like crack. I&#8217;m not
crazy about their tandoori.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They decided to get
the vegetable pakoras, saag paneer, chicken korma, garlic naan, and rice. Marin ordered a chili-mango-vodka concoction called The Monsoon, and Charlie
ordered a beer.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;When did you
graduate from MIT?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;&#8216;98, but I skipped
first grade, so I&#8217;m twenty-seven if you&#8217;re trying to figure out the age
difference. What about you?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I graduated in
2002, no skipping. I could have skipped third grade, but I decided not to. I
didn&#8217;t want to leave my friends.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Skipping first
grade didn&#8217;t damage any essential social relationships that I developed during
my nine months in kindergarten,&#148; said Charlie, &#147;but it did kind of suck later
when I was the last one in my class to drive or buy alcohol.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess people do
it so that their kids can become financially independent one year earlier down
the road,&#148; said Marin, &#147;but I&#8217;ve never thought that it made much sense for the
child being skipped, even academically.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think it&#8217;s
fallen out of fashion,&#148; said Charlie. He shrugged. &#147;My life would have turned
out the same either way.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you would still
be sitting here with me even if you had been Mr. Average Joe Completer of First
Grade?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Unless they teach
you in first grade that cute data/information specialists are the devil,&#148; he
said. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed. &#147;Oh, please,&#148; she said. &#147;Being pure evil can not be as boring as what I do all
day. If only I had the option of skipping a year of data/information
specializing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You do have that
option,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;It&#8217;s called unemployment.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Their waiter
brought them their drinks. Marin&#8217;s cocktail was in a highball glass: concave
cubes of ice in a mango yellow suspension streaked with ribbons of red chili
juice and green flecks of muddled mint.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, cheers,&#148;
Charlie said, raising his beer bottle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;To skipping the
right parts,&#148; said Marin, picking up her cocktail glass and clinking his bottle
with it.</p>

<p class="last">Charlie smiled his
already-familiar smile and drank.</p>

<p class="first">Ben was sitting at Zelig Bar&#8217;s bar with a
pint of wheat beer when Marin came in, wearing jeans and a dark orange blouse
that showed off her tattoo. This was her first time in Zelig, and its low
ceilings and Grinch-green light disoriented her. She was also a little bit
hung over.</p>

<p class="Story">She had drunk two
Monsoons at dinner the night before, followed by half a bottle of wine at a
hookah bar (whose nearness to the dinner place Marin was certain had not been a
coincidence). The inside of her mouth was still chalky and bitter with
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie&#8217;s mouth had tasted like the sweet fake fruit flavoring
of the shisha. The sex that they&#8217;d had in his Alamo Square apartment that night had
been greedy and chaotic, an unapologetic race to the finish line that somehow
had resulted in a thrilling photo finish. Only afterward, lying together naked
and loopy on Charlie&#8217;s grubby second-hand futon, did Charlie inform Marin that
his mother owned the building and lived downstairs. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin tried to do
Nazneen&#8217;s close-and-open-eyes refresh thing and walked over to Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey,&#148; she said. &#147;No sign of &#8216;Mr. Garcia?&#8217;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nope,&#148; said Ben. &#147;How&#8217;d your date go last night?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think he&#8217;s a
little bit too much my type,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Too much of a
sarcastic flameout?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s not my
type, is it?&#148; Marin asked. &#147;Max wasn&#8217;t a flameout.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s got some
self-destructive tendencies,&#148; said Ben. &#147;He keeps saying he wants to quit his
job and become a contractor.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do people really
think that I&#8217;m that girl?&#148; said Marin. &#147;That girl who likes bad boys?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I dated Nazneen
for more than a year. I judge no one,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">The door to the bar
opened and a man whose thinness bordered on emaciation entered carrying a black
leather doctor&#8217;s bag. He had stringy chin-length bottle-red hair with a longer
stripe of bright purple that hung over his right eye.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben got up and
approached him. &#147;Mr. Garcia?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">The man nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m Ben Blakeman
from Mud23 Gallery,&#148; Ben said. He held out his hand.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia shook it and
followed Ben to the bar.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin introduced
herself and asked Garcia if he wanted anything to drink.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ginger ale,
please,&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben ordered Garcia
a ginger ale and asked him what was in the bag.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>&#8216;I don&#8217;t think
there&#8217;s anything in that black bag for me,&#8217;</i>&#148; Garcia said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>The Wizard of
Oz</i>,&#148; said Ben. &#147;That&#8217;s what Dorothy says to the Wizard after he gives the
Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion what they&#8217;ve wished for.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia looked
pleased that Ben had gotten his reference. &#147;What do people wish for nowadays?&#148;
he asked. &#147;Courage? Brains? Heart? Home?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People want the
thing itself now,&#148; said Marin, &#147;happiness.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very interesting
answer,&#148; said Garcia. &#147;There are many people who believe that happiness can be
found in a black doctor&#8217;s bag, and there are many people who need their
psychological and spiritual life to be a sacred space that science and medicine
do not touch.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what kind of
person are you?&#148; asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m the kind of
person who carries around <i>this</i> in a black doctor&#8217;s bag,&#148; Garcia said,
opening his bag and taking out four tall glass jar candles, the kind sold in
Mexican grocery stores, with images of Jesus and the Virgin of Guadalupe
painted onto the sides. GXG had carefully bleached the religious images off
his candles&#8217; jars and on each of them had skillfully tagged a word in graffiti
bubble letters: </p>

<p class="tightcenter"><b>COO RAGE</b></p>

<p class="tightcenter"><b>BRAYNZ</b></p>

<p class="tightcenter"><b>H&#8217;ART</b></p>

<p class="tightcenter"><b>H&#211;M</b></p>

<p class="Story">He reached into his
bag again and, using both hands, lifted from it a white resin casting in the
shape of a 28-day pill caddy, with the Spanish initials for the days of the
week (L, Ma, Mi, J, V, S, D) written on top of the compartments in red glitter
glue.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Which is the fairy
tale and which is the science?&#148; Garcia asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;One could argue
that wisdom, fearlessness, generosity, and community are all qualities built
systematically through a rich spiritual life,&#148; said Ben. He picked up the
H&#8217;ART candle and studied Garcia&#8217;s handiwork. &#147;Your work has a strong
undercurrent of sadness that&#8217;s very moving. There is a dialectical yet
constellatory relationship of the outsider with the popular pop art mainstream
that parallels the subtextural dialectical yet constellatory relationship of
death and life.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia took a sip
of his ginger ale. &#147;How old are you two?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re both
twenty-four,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You seem younger,&#148;
said Garcia, &#147;but that&#8217;s probably because all of the other
twenty-four-year-olds I know are hoboes and alcoholics. Would you like to see
my studio?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They said &#147;yes,&#148;
and Garcia put his things back into his bag. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Ben went
outside to find a cab while Garcia went to the bathroom. A bratty night wind
blew about and threw the door shut behind them.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s something
off about him,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Considering
everything he&#8217;s been through, I thought he seemed pretty normal,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s true,&#148; she
said. &#147;It&#8217;s just&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The door opened,
and a man came out, cigarette in mouth, flicking a lighter on behind cupped
hands.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin continued in
a low voice: &#147;He&#8217;s not exactly what I expected from the postcard. There&#8217;s
something calculating about him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s probably
thinking the exact same thing about us,&#148; said Ben. He stepped off the curb to
flag an approaching taxi, but it didn&#8217;t stop.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin, not wanting
to risk being overheard by Garcia and lose his trust, changed the subject. &#147;I
sent my RSVP in,&#148; she said. &#147;It&#8217;ll be just me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, okay, cool,&#148;
said Ben. &#147;I just got Max&#8217;s too. He&#8217;s bringing his sister. She&#8217;s a freshman
at Berkeley, you know?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I heard that she
was starting there. That&#8217;s cool that she&#8217;s coming,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I can&#8217;t
believe that Max actually committed to a social event two months in advance.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People change,&#148; Ben said absently.</p>

<p class="last">He looked back at
the door to the bar. &#147;Can you wait here for Garcia? I&#8217;m going to see if I can
snag a cab on 16th Street.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Five minutes later, Ben pulled up in a cab
just as Garcia emerged from Zelig. Marin got in the backseat with Ben, and
Garcia rode shotgun.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s suspicious
feeling toward Garcia subsided as they rode through the city in silence. He
seemed nervous, repeatedly wiping his hair back from his face with the bottom
of his palm.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia&#8217;s
neighborhood&#151;it was Marin&#8217;s first time in Hunter&#8217;s Point&#151;was residential and
quiet. Garcia told the cab driver to slow down in front
of a brown two-story construction with a one-car garage on the first floor. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My garage is my
studio,&#148; Garcia said, &#147;which is much, much more than some people have.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben paid for the
taxi, and as he waited for his change Garcia unlocked the garage door and
pushed it open with both arms, rattling the old metal tracks.</p>

<div style="page-break-after:always"></div>

<div class="sun"><%= image_tag "books/o/ch9.png", alt: "Chapter 9" %></div>
<h2>Sarawak : 2002</h2>
<h3>Will</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">W</span>ill caught his fall on a tree, but his
right arm skidded hard against its cracked bark. He could smell the blood. Funny how it smelled like metal, like rust. Man and machine weren&#8217;t made of
such different stuff after all.</p>

<p class="Story">Anwar kneeled down
beside him and looked concerned. &#147;Ouch,&#148; he said. &#147;Maybe you need stitch
again.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will had gotten
into a motorcycle accident in town a month ago, and the emergency room physician
at Kuching State Hospital had stitched up some small gashes on his face and
elbow. Will had healed quickly. He always healed quickly.</p>

<p class="Story">Now, not in town
but surrounded by acres upon acres of primary growth rainforest, Will took off
his backpack and, all with his left hand, unzipped the main compartment and
fished around in it for his first aid kit. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Naw,&#148; he said. &#147;I
think I just need to clean it off and put some gauze on it so that I don&#8217;t drip
blood everywhere. Nobody likes a bloody jungle path.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Hiking was a
sacrosanct business at the O/URC. Everyone did it with each other. It didn&#8217;t
matter if someone annoyed the hell out of you, or didn&#8217;t know five words of any
of the languages that you spoke&#151;at least once a month you went off into the woods
with that person. The people that you actually liked you hiked with at least
once a week otherwise they started to think that something was wrong and take
offense.</p>

<p class="Story">Anwar was one of
Will&#8217;s favorite people at the O/URC, so they went hiking together in the
jungles in and around their research area one to two times each week. Anwar
was, at twenty-four, still very much the scrappy kid from Sematan whose
preternatural ability to &#147;read&#148; the jungle and its mood swings had (despite
Anwar&#8217;s lack of any higher education or scientific training) secured him a
position of unspecified but unchallenged authority at the O/URC.</p>

<p class="Story">Dr. St. James
cleaned and dressed his own wound with the precise, economical moves of a
&#147;real&#148; doctor. He only had a thin strip of gauze left in his kit, so he placed
it along the center of his scrape and taped it to his arm with three tiny
band-aids.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So the American
girl is a Chinese girl?&#148; Anwar asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She&#8217;s Chinese in
race but American in nationality,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah,&#148; he said,
&#147;like Malaysian-Chinese.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Exactly,&#148; said
Will. &#147;Like Linda.&#148; Linda was the O/URC&#8217;s head of veterinary medicine. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But less
annoying-lah, hopefully,&#148; said Anwar.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda means well,&#148;
said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Anwar. &#147;She means being very, very annoying.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will laughed. &#147;You&#8217;re
right. But she&#8217;s a very good vet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;True,&#148; said
Anwar. &#147;True.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s get going&#151;I
promised Wan I&#8217;d check on the state of the six-ten path, and we have to
get back to campus before noon so that we can eat and shower and get to the
airport in time,&#148; said Will, standing.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin was scheduled
to arrive at the airport in Kuching at four-thirty that afternoon, and Will was
actually nervous. Marin was someone that he could see himself being friends
with in Montreal. However, there weren&#8217;t that many people in Montreal that he
could see himself being friends with in Montreal, so this metric was more than
suspect. As the months had passed waiting for Marin&#8217;s visa application to be
approved, Will had begun to worry that his impression of the girl had been
wrong. What if Marin&#8217;s low-key California cool didn&#8217;t translate to Borneo? What if she had ulterior motives? What if she had a nervous breakdown? (This
particular English phrase needed no translation for the longstanding Iban and
Bidayuh members of the O/URC&#8217;s staff for a reason.) Was Will responsible for
Marin if she turned out to be crazy or bitchy or incompetent? </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Whatever</i>, Will thought. Wan had wanted to hire her too, and he was the one with a genuine say in such
matters. Besides, Marin had gotten her fellowship transferred, or what was
left of it at least, so the O/URC wouldn&#8217;t even be paying her anything but her
visa application fees and plane ticket fare for her first six months of work. If it didn&#8217;t work out, no harm, no foul.</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Anwar
punched silently through wet forest, and after a minute both men froze in
position. They both had heard the same thing: a whisper, really; a few
branches broken in quick succession. Both men&#8217;s expertise and intuition had
told them that a wild orangutan was nearby in the canopy, a female, and that
she was moving fast.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it Rini?&#148; asked
Anwar. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She&#8217;s moving that
way,&#148; said Will, pointing southwest. &#147;Can we cut across through there?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They moved quickly,
backtracking a few yards and then trotting down a narrow path that led the same
way that the orangutan was going. She slowed her pace in front of a mango
tree, and the two men caught up. As she swung out from a nearby dipterocarp to
grab at a ripe piece of yellow fruit, her fur flashed bright orange in the
sunlight for a moment and her pregnant belly came clearly into Will&#8217;s view. She bit into the mango and the expanded radii and circumference of her simian
jaw contorted smoothly with the chewing of it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s Rini,&#148; Will
whispered, taking his notebook and a pen out of his backpack without taking his
eyes off the orangutan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She look okay,&#148;
Anwar said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can&#8217;t believe
that she&#8217;s the same age as Penny,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Penny was an
ex-captive adult female orangutan who had spent most of her life as the pet of a high-ranking military officer. She had been removed from her cage in the officer&#146;s home and brought to the O/URC for
rehabilitation two months ago. She was much fatter and weaker than Rini due to
her diet of pandan cake and lack of exercise outside the act of raising pieces
of pandan cake to her face. Nevertheless, she was a lively presence, gesturing
to and lip-smacking at any humans that came within range of her quarantine cage
at the O/URC. When Penny had been let out of her cage last week so that the O/URC vet Linda
could check out a small unidentified sore behind her ear, she had jumped out of
Linda&#8217;s assistant&#8217;s arms and run off, climbing up and onto the roof of a
neighboring cage. She&#8217;d shrieked and lip-smacked at the assistant and other staff
members who&#146;d tried to coax her down.</p>

<p class="Story">If she settled down
enough to be released one day and mate, Penny would make a skittish, combative
mother, unlike Rini, who hung sideways, silent and without expression, her left
hand and foot secured on a tree branch, and gnawing at the mango in her right
hand. </p>

<p class="Story">Sometimes visiting
researchers at the O/URC would wonder why ex-captive orangutans like Penny
acted out. Certainly the ex-captives&#8217; time in captivity had been awful and
physically debilitating, but once rescued, fed, and rehabilitated medically,
shouldn&#8217;t their natural instincts kick in? Couldn&#8217;t they look at a wild
orangutan and a human being and tell immediately which they belonged with? Did
apes even have the neurological physiology and chemistry to fall prey to human
psychosocial disorders like Stockholm syndrome or abandoned child syndrome?</p>

<p class="Story">To some extent this
type of skepticism was valid, and some orangutans were just this resilient. However, the more adaptable a creature, Will believed, the more susceptible it
could be to non-physical forms of trauma. A bug kept in a jar for a year and
then released was still a bug. An orangutan, on the other hand, was
intelligent enough to get confused.</p>

<p class="last">Even Rini, one of
only a few hundred thousand wild orangutans left in the world, looking as if
she&#8217;d grown out of the jungle just as seamlessly as the mango tree she was
feeding from: this very act, eating in plain view of two humans, was contrary
to her better instincts. Sure, Will and Anwar had tracked her before&#151;Anwar
since she was young&#151;and they&#8217;d slowly earned her trust over time. However,
Rini knew nothing about human motivation. What if since their last encounter
the men had stumbled upon hard times and decided to poach an orangutan for some
quick cash? For better or worse, Rini had adapted to two human beings,
sometime predators of her kind. Some combination of laziness, curiosity, and
hard calculation had led her to decide that she would rather let Will and Wan
watch her eat this mango than duck their trail and keep searching for food.</p>

<p class="first">Six hours later Will and Anwar were at
Kuching International Airport holding a piece of copy paper that had &#147;MARIN
CHOO&#148; written across it in black permanent marker. Like all of Will&#8217;s attempts
at any craft-like project, it looked like the construction of a ten-year-old.</p>

<p class="Story">Kuching, the
capital city of the Malaysian state of Sarawak, was a post-colonial river town
whose balance of sun-baked sleepiness and low-key enterprise seemed, at times,
more Catalan than Straits in temperament. It was a little over two hours from
the O/URC by car; a little under two hours by motorbike.</p>

<p class="Story">On those few
occasions when Will and Anwar had come into town together previously, they had
caravanned in on a pair of the O/URC&#8217;s bright blue Hondas. This time they had
borrowed Linda&#8217;s tiny pine-green Proton sedan (Will drove) and blasted the
Stones and the air-conditioning at full volume. They&#8217;d sung (Anwar well and
Will badly) along with Mick, but the start-and-stop traffic coming into the
city had still made the drive seem long.</p>

<p class="Story">People, mainly
Malaysians on or returning from vacations, came out of the airport baggage
claim and down the fenced-in arrivals track, rolling and shouldering
unfashionable parcels of luggage. Three Malay college-age girls walked out
together in a line; their white tudungs made them look like Matroyshka dolls
with backpacks. Will had a brief and specific vision of himself in ten years,
returning from a two-week vacation in Paris and shouldering his belongings in
an ugly red duffel bag with frayed white tubing outlining its circular ends. Although he&#8217;d never lived in Paris, it still felt wrong that the site of his
hypothetical vacation should be a European city and his hypothetical home an
Asian one. He had somehow leapfrogged from science boy to nature boy to expat
boy without making a conscious decision to be this last thing, a creature whose
borrowed privilege and suspect self-exile Will had always regarded in the
abstract with some amount of scorn.</p>

<p class="Story">Just as Will had this thought, a girl with a crow tattoo and very cute matching
teal-and-purple plaid luggage came down the walkway. She lifted her sunglasses
up a notch and peered underneath, scanning the crowd. Will waved to Marin. She saw him and wheeled her bags over to him and Anwar.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Welcome to Borneo,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="first">The hawker center that they stopped at for lunch was an open-air tile and
concrete structure that looked something like a parking garage. It was filled
with cheap plastic tables and chairs. Along its perimeter, Chinese and Malay
men and women pan-fried, steamed, and boiled noodles, meat, and rice at food
stalls. Fans bolted to the top of the structure&#8217;s support columns spun to
white blurs and panned slowly from side to side. </p>

<p class="Story">Despite its humble
mise-en-sc&#232;ne, Will had gradually come around to his coworkers&#8217; opinion that
this hawker center had some of the best food in Kuching. Its regulars included
people from all walks of life: lawyers, government officials, university
students, bus drivers, nurses, construction workers, and auto repair men all sat at tables consuming bowls of noodles, plates of fried meat and rice, and colorful sweets and snacks. Will was, at this moment, however, the only white person in the
crowd.</p>

<p class="Story">Anwar went to a
stall in the far corner to order his food while Will led Marin to the near row
of food stalls. &#147;This woman makes pretty good char kuay teow, which is a fried
rice noodle dish. This guy here makes kolo mee, which is supposedly a local
specialty, but it involves ramen noodles which I tend to stay away from now
that I&#8217;m an impoverished researcher instead of an impoverished graduate
student.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed, and
they proceeded to the next stall.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, this is good,&#148;
said Will. &#147;This guy sells ais kacang, which is this shaved ice dessert.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I want that
later,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">They continued
around nearly the entire perimeter of vendors. They liked the same things,
thought the same things were funny or gross or odd. Marin got fried rice from
a vendor that Will recommended, and Will got a char kuay teow. Anwar was
sitting at a table alone, and almost finished with his rice dish, when they sat
down with their trays across from him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What happened to
your arm?&#148; Marin asked, pointing to Will&#8217;s arm scrape from that morning.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Orangutan bite,&#148;
Anwar deadpanned.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ha-ha-ha,&#148; said
Will. &#147;What a comedian.&#148; He explained to Marin, &#147;I slid while hiking up a
muddy path this morning and scraped myself. Orangutans have bitten humans
before at the O/URC, but not very often. You got your rabies shots, though,
right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Marin. &#147;All three of them.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;None of the
orangutans are rabid, but there are a lot of macaque monkeys around, and
they&#8217;re very aggressive and once in awhile one of them is infected,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Once a macaque
almost bite my thumb off,&#148; said Anwar. He held up his right hand, thumb-side
out. There was a tiny white scar where his thumb was joined to his palm, two
small raised lines like acute and grave accent marks. &#147;I am eating cookies,
and macaque, like, love cookies. I don&#8217;t know he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s on my roof. He
drop down&#151;&#148; Anwar mimed the monkey dropping down in front of him. &#147;&#151;and is
grabbing my hand with the cookie. I hit him away and throw the cookie, thinking
he go run and get the cookie. Instead he grab my hand again and bite my
thumb.&#148; Anwar put his thumb in his mouth, made a dry expectoral noise, opened
his mouth, and out popped a piece of chicken meat. Anwar smiled wide.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin almost choked
on her rice. She looked at Will and raised her eyebrows as if to say, <i>how
awesome is this guy? </i>Will smiled, shook his head, and looked down, which
meant: <i>yeah, I know, he&#8217;s totally awesome</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m scared he have
rabies, but he okay,&#148; said Anwar. &#147;Just don&#8217;t eat cookies, the macaques won&#8217;t
bother you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah,&#148; said Will,
&#147;that&#8217;s not really true, but definitely never, ever, ever feed them cookies. That&#8217;s a surefire way to invite trouble into your life.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Trouble?&#148; said
Marin. &#147;Don&#8217;t you mean &#8216;monkey&#8217; business?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Ehhhhehhh</i>&#133;&#148;
said Will. &#147;That was terrible.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed. &#147;I
had to get it out of my system, sorry. I&#8217;m done &#8216;monkeying&#8217; around now.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Now Will laughed
for real. Marin and Anwar looked at each other and cracked up too. Will
couldn&#8217;t believe it&#151;he had actually pulled it off. He had found a workable
compromise for his orientation issue. All of his anxiety these past few months
had been for nothing. Marin was here, she was totally awesome, she totally got
him and got Sarawak, and Will couldn&#8217;t wait to get back to the O/URC and get to
work.</p>

<p class="first">Marin&#8217;s orientation to the O/URC consisted
of walking around the campus with Will to meet all of the core players, and,
after each meeting, walking out of earshot and getting the scuttlebutt from
Will on that person&#8217;s quirks and pet peeves, as well as Will&#8217;s tips on how to
curry favor with him or her.</p>

<p class="Story">First they went to
see Wan, whom Marin had not spoken to since his and Will&#8217;s ill-fated
presentation at Pac in August. </p>

<p class="Story">Wan was in his office, looking at the report of the O/URC&#8217;s latest release. The release team had been Will, three other staff members, and a helicopter pilot, a Chinese man from Kuching that everyone called Jo-Jo even though his name was actually Bo-Yim. Will and another staff member had sedated eighteen orangutans, packed them in crates, and loaded the crates into the helicopter. Jo-Jo had flown the crated orangutans to a new drop-off site outside Batang Kapuas while Will and the others had driven the jeep out to meet them by land. The anesthetic that they had given the orangutans had started to wear off when they arrived. They had immediately opened the crates, and Will and another staff member had checked the apes&#8217; vitals and helped them walk off the drug. They had packed the empty crates back into the chopper, driving and flying the vehicles back to the O/URC minutes before sunset. A textbook O/URC release.</p>

<p class="Story">Will reintroduced Wan and Marin, and Wan asked Marin how her flight had been.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I slept through most of it, and you can&#146;t really ask for anything more than that,&#148; she said.</p>
<p class="Story">Will nodded. That&#146;s how she described a twenty-hour flight with two stopovers&#151;she got it.</p>
<p class="Story">&#147;So one thing I want you to be thinking about is,&#148; Wan said, &#147;how do we get people overseas&#151;in the States, in the West, in other places in Asia&#151;to care about these small yet critical things we do here? I used to think this is the easy job&#151;telling people all the things we do. Now I know&#151;there are so many things. You need something special, something different and new, to break through. Do you know what I mean?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Wan&#8217;s ceiling fan,
which was on at a low setting, creaked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I know
what you mean,&#148; said Marin. &#147;You want to capture the urgency of the
orangutan&#8217;s dilemma in a narrative.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Yes!&#148; said Wan,
snapping his fingers. Will had never seen him snap his fingers before, but was
not surprised that he did it well, exactly the way that they did it in old movies. &#147;Exactly! A narrative. That&#8217;s what we need, a narrative.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">After leaving Wan, Will walked Marin to the medical station for her next introductions.</p>

<p class="Story">It was a nice day;
a gentle breeze tinkled the wind chimes that hung at the entrance gate several
hundred yards away. Will was glad that Marin&#8217;s first impression of the O/URC
was on a day like this. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The key to Wan is
to run everything by him first,&#148; Will said. &#147;He&#8217;s not a micromanager, but he
likes to be the guy who knows everything.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They approached the
medical center (or &#147;med,&#148; as it was usually called, Will explained to Marin), a
plain green building with narrow rolled-plate-glass windows and a flat concrete
roof. It was the only building at the O/URC with air-conditioning. As they
turned off the concrete lattice path that connected some of the main buildings
(the administrative offices, &#147;office;&#148; the canteen, &#147;canteen;&#148; and the meeting
hall, &#147;meet&#148;) onto a narrow dirt path leading to med, the veterinary assistant Dilip
emerged from the front door of med, holding hands with an orangutan female
named Winnie and walking her down the steps. Winnie was tipsy with anesthetic.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What happened to
Winnie?&#148; asked Will.</p>

<p class="Story">Winnie was wearing
a paper surgical mask to protect her from germs during her walk through the
main grounds. Dilip was still wearing his scrubs and had a surgical mask
hanging loose on his neck. Protocol dictated that Dilip should have changed
from his scrubs into street clothes before leaving med, but likely Dilip had
had his hands full with Winnie and had made an exception.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She went crazy,
man,&#148; said Dilip. &#147;And Malik shot her with the tranq. She rest okay now so
Linda is wanting her back in O.Q.&#148; O.Q. was Orangutan Quarantine.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is Linda operating
right now?&#148; asked Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, she just
checking on the baby ex-caps,&#148; said Dilip.</p>

<p class="Story">Will introduced
Marin to Dilip.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I should get her
back,&#148; Dilip said, referring to Winnie. &#147;You guys going to canteen for
dinner?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yep,&#148; said Will. &#147;Ayam goreng night, my favorite.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Dilip smiled and walked away with the petite ape.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ayam goreng&#151;fried
chicken?&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Uh-huh,&#148; said
Will. &#147;Look at you, all knowing of the Bahasa.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Aren&#8217;t &#8216;fried&#8217; and
&#8216;chicken&#8217; two of the first words that <i>you</i> learn in every language?&#148; Marin
asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Will laughed and
opened the door to med. Cold air wafted out, and he and Marin went in. When
the door had closed behind them, Will said, &#147;Dilip&#8217;s a super nice guy, quiet,
but very easy to work with. You haven&#8217;t been sick in the past two weeks, have
you? Cold? Flu?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cool,&#148; said Will. &#147;Then we&#8217;ll go meet some ex-captive orangutans, which we call &#8216;ex-caps.&#8217; And Linda, our chief vet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will led Marin down
a short hallway to the locker room. They took turns using the changing stall
to change into scrubs. They put paper masks on their faces and plastic booties
over their shoes and exited the locker room directly into a small room with a
sink, where Will taught Marin to scrub her hands and arms clean with brown
antiseptic soap. As a final precaution, they put on purple latex gloves. </p>

<p class="Story">They left through
the scrub room&#8217;s other door directly into the quarantined area of med. Will
led Marin down a short hallway lit with mirror-backed blue LEDs to a door with
a small silver sign that said: <i>&#147;Transitional Animal Intake: Level 5
Quarantine.&#148;</i> Will opened the door and led Marin inside. </p>

<p class="Story">The lights were
dimmed very low, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel was playing softly on a boombox in
the corner. Linda, a thirty-eight-year-old Malaysian-Chinese woman wearing
faded blue scrubs, was peering into the next-to-last Plexiglass box in a row of
one-foot-square Plexiglass boxes laid along the center of a narrow stainless
steel table in the middle of the room. She had an LED pen flashlight in her
right hand that she was pressing on at the end with her thumb and aiming from
various angles at the orangutan cub curled up in the middle of the box.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What is this,
Simon &amp; Garfunkel?&#148; said Will. &#147;I didn&#8217;t know you were such a hippie,
Linda.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; said
Linda. She stood straight, placed the flashlight in her shirt pocket, and
walked over to them. &#147;Where&#8217;s my car, lying at the bottom of a ditch
somewhere?&#148; She muttered something in Chinese, and Marin laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda looked
alarmed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The glorious
Proton is fine,&#148; Will said. &#147;This is Marin Choo, our new communications director. She speaks Amoy, Cantonese, and Tagalog fluently.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And, full
disclosure, a tiny bit of Mandarin,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your parents are
from Fujian?&#148; Linda asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My mom was,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;But she grew up in the Philippines. My dad is Cantonese from Hong
Kong.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And they met
where, in Hong Kong?&#148; Linda asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In the U.S.,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;In Ohio, of all places.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You must get very
confused sometimes,&#148; Linda said. &#147;Nice to meet you. Dr. Linda Tsai.&#148; She
reached out her gloved hand. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin took it, and
Linda gave it a wan squeeze. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda took off her
glasses and rubbed the lenses with the bottom of her scrub shirt. She put them
back on her face. &#147;So what are you doing for us, exactly?&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;As I understand
it,&#148; Marin said, &#147;I&#8217;m reaching out to international corporate consumers of palm
oil and the big environmental NGO players around the world to educate them
about palm oil&#8217;s harmful effects on the rainforest in Borneo and its numerous
endangered species inhabitants, including the orangutans, of course.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then?&#148; said
Linda.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then nobody
ever makes or buys another bottle of palm oil again,&#148; Will said. &#147;That&#8217;s how
good this girl is.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No pressure or
anything,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sure you will do the best you can,&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will was both
annoyed at and anxious about Linda&#8217;s withholding of direct approval of the
(his) Marin project. As Anwar had indicated that morning, many people found
Linda annoying, but she also
was an influential person at the O/URC, and Will preferred to keep on her good
side.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, shouldn&#8217;t we
show Marin the babies?&#148; Will said. &#147;If that won&#8217;t get the inspiration juices
flowing, I don&#8217;t know what will.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s okay if
they&#8217;re too vulnerable right now,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I understand.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s not just that
they&#8217;re vulnerable,&#148; Linda said. &#147;They are also rare tropical animals
undergoing an environmental transition with specific procedures. They got
enough cooing over at the petting zoo we rescued them from.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t &#8216;coo&#8217;
generally,&#148; Marin said, &#147;but that makes sense.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey Linda&#151;Anwar
and I saw Rini this morning,&#148; Will said. </p>

<p class="Story">He was not
arbitrarily changing the subject. The pregnant wild orangutan that he&#8217;d seen
on his hike that morning had never, for whatever reason, let down her guard
around Linda. Whenever Linda tried to follow Rini, the ape would go ballistic:
breaking off branches and throwing them at Linda and lip-smacking until Linda
left her sight. It was a sore point for the veterinarian, who prided herself
on the respect she earned from all of the other wild apes and the ex-caps, all
while keeping a disciplined distance from them. In bringing up Rini, Will,
like an adult male orangutan bellowing a long call through a stretch of
staked-out forest territory, had reasserted his position as Linda&#8217;s equal of
sorts.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, is she
okay?&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Positively
glowing,&#148; Will said. &#147;I think she&#8217;s five months.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, we knew
that,&#148; Linda said. &#147;Captain Kirk is the father. They mated three times
in June.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Captain Kirk was
the dominant male in Section C, the southeastern part of their research area. He had been named thusly by Wan for his broad Captain Kirk-like shoulders and
playful but aggressive personality. His fur was also darker around his
shoulders, like a Starfleet uniform.</p>

<p class="Story">Despite Linda&#8217;s
initial pithy, nonplussed response, she next asked Will, &#147;You think we can go
to Section C next time we hike?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">This was as far as
Linda would go in asking Will to help get her &#147;in&#148; with Rini, not that such a
thing was necessarily even possible.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Most of the babies
are sleeping right now, but Gia is the oldest and she&#8217;s awake,&#148; she said. &#147;She&#8217;s pretty strong. You can come look at her for one minute, Marin. Just
keep your mask on, okay?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Will and Marin
followed Linda to the first Plexiglass box, where a dark brown body the size of
a large mango was lying on its back on cotton bedding; the sheet&#8217;s print of
thin red lines crisscrossed into diamonds had faded to pink. Gia&#8217;s sparse
reddish fur stuck out from her torso and limbs at odd angles and her big black
eyes blinked open and closed slowly. Will smiled; there was still nothing
quite as miraculous as a baby orangutan. He moved to the side and gently
pushed Marin closer to the box, and he watched her peer in. Gia yawned, her
teacup lip jaw stretching into her neck, and a single tiny bubble popped at the
corner of her mouth. Marin didn&#8217;t speak, and her face was obscured by her
surgical mask, but Will could see the love and ache and laughter in the
American&#8217;s eyes. Now, more than ever, he knew that their side had to win.</p>

<p class="first">Marin and Will walked for several minutes
in silence as they left med. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda <i>hates </i>me,&#148;
Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">Will considered
contradicting her, but said instead, &#147;You&#8217;ll win her over eventually. Just
remember, the work is key with her. If you produce results that she can
actually see, she&#8217;ll love you forever. Then you won&#8217;t be able to get rid of
her. Also, she&#8217;s very religious.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Christian or
Buddhist?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Christian,&#148; said
Will. &#147;Are you&#133;?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Lapsed Catholic,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, that won&#8217;t
help you with Linda,&#148; said Will, &#147;or, you know, not burning in hell for all of
eternity.&#148; He added, &#147;she doesn&#8217;t wear her wedding ring in quarantine, but
she&#8217;s married. Her husband is an accountant, I think? He lives in Kuching,
and she drives out there every other weekend and stays over for one or two
nights.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Interesting,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Where to next?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re going to
take a slight detour,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">They walked
side-by-side down a narrow concrete path. To their right, a row of large
flowering tropical plants that the O/URC&#146;s botanist had planted separated
them from med&#8217;s parking and waste management area. To their left, barely kept
at bay by constant maintenance by their grounds staff, was the jungle. </p>

<p class="Story">After a minute, an
unmarked concrete road appeared on their left. Will turned onto this road, and
Marin followed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The babies that
you just saw at med are only there for a few more weeks, until they get their
vaccinations and get stronger,&#148; Will said. &#147;They will join the other ex-caps
out in Orangutan Quarantine, or &#8216;O.Q.,&#8217; then. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The jungle&#151;such an
abstraction, an emotional rhetorical flourish really, when Will and Marin had
been last standing together in the elevator bank of the Pac Development Bank&#8217;s
office tower in San Francisco&#151;was now, in all its dense millions of parts,
growing up around them. That Eden had been a jungle&#151;not a beach, berry field,
or volcanic hot spring&#151;seemed right and just to Will. Like all righteous things,
the jungle had an order: a kind out of reach of ordinary human perception. To
know with too much self-certainty its workings&#151;why the loris hunts at night,
the green death of a closing leaf swallowing black insects into its poisoned
deep&#151;was to unwittingly help sow the seeds of its destruction. Scale was
relative: a lesson that Will and Marin&#8217;s species always seemed to learn too
late.</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin
walked approximately one kilometer before the road ended at a chain-link fence,
where one of the O/URC&#8217;s miniature flatbed trucks was parked. A common padlock
locked the gate to the fence, which Will opened with one of the many keys on
his keychain. He led Marin inside, and locked the door behind them. (One
never knew when a macaque was going to get a little too brave and curious for
its own good.) O.Q. was six thirty-foot-by-thirty-foot pitched roofs placed
three-by-two in a rectangle, supported by twenty-two-foot-high concrete columns
and enclosed with chain-link fence on all four sides. Inside were twelve
twelve-foot-by-sixteen-foot twelve-foot-high cages, each of which held seven or
more orangutans. The animals smelled rich, crude, and haunted&#151;potent as a new
well of petroleum just pumped to surface.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;O.Q. duty shifts
from week to week,&#148; Will said. &#147;The person who is on duty comes two times a
day to check on the orangutans, hose off their cages, and feed them. He or she
records his observations in the log book, and reports any significant matters
to Linda and Wan.&#148; Will picked up the log book and removed it from its
dirt-caked ziplock bag wrapping. A leather-bound ledger the size of a photo
album, Will flipped a few pages to show Marin: it was filled with grid paper
and hand-written notations. </p>

<p class="Story">He led Marin around
the perimeter of the orangutan cages, making sure they kept a two-foot distance
from the cages. Some orangutans slept, or laid still, and some jumped around
in their cages, banged the bars, and kiss-squeaked as Will and Marin passed. Some were occupied in cleaning their teeth with leaves, and some of the older
females were grooming younger orangutans whom they had adopted (or, in some
cases, who had adopted them).</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It seems wrong to
keep them caged, but none of these orangutans are wild,&#148; Will said. &#147;They are
all ex-captives, most of whom were living in much smaller cages&#151;or worse&#151;before
they were rescued. It&#8217;s temporary, and it&#8217;s to avoid overexposure to humans. They are released back into the wild as soon as they are ready. They are taken
out every one or two days to learn basic climbing and survival skills from
other orangutans who are further along in the rehabilitation process.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin nodded,
studying each orangutan and cage they passed.</p>

<p class="Story">Will had used an
anonymous passive voice, but he was the lead developer and administrator of the
orangutans&#8217; lessons. It was a strange and perverse thing, to teach another
species how to be less like your own species and more like their own, and the
O/URC had its share of critics, Marin&#8217;s former boss Ray Marcos among them. All
the same, when you saw the ex-caps in the jungle, learning: nobody could say
that it wasn&#8217;t right, nobody. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s go see if
Gandau is home,&#148; Will said, as they returned to the front of O.Q.</p>

<p class="Story">Will unlocked the
door with his key.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And would Gandau
be an orangutan or person?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Gandau is a
fifty-three-year-old Iban man. He is, however, known for
his occasional supernatural communications with orangutans. My ex Petey would
have hated Gandau,&#148; Will said. They left O.Q., and Will locked the fence door
behind them.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He always hated
people who have become the most outlandish parts of their personalities, which
Gandau kind of is,&#148; Will said. &#147;But that was only because Petey didn&#8217;t have a
personality.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Plus, with a name
like Gandau, one would be disappointed without at least a little
outlandishness,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will laughed. &#147;Seriously,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you like guys,
huh?&#148; Marin said. &#147;I thought maybe you did, but you&#146;re a little hard to read.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve been out
since high school,&#148; Will said, &#147;but I&#8217;m sort of, as in completely, back in the
closet here. The whole sodomy punishable-by-caning thing ain&#8217;t exactly
encouraging for raising one&#8217;s freak flag, you know?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Got it,&#148; said
Marin. &#147;I&#8217;m glad you told me, but my lips are sealed.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">It was unexpectedly strange for Will to be
standing at the threshold of the Iban elder&#8217;s bungalow next to someone who knew
his orientation, and he felt a little giddy. So Will was
grateful when Gandau&#8217;s first words when he opened his door were, &#147;Too early for
tuak?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s never too early
for tuak,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Gandau, a slim,
brown-skinned Asian man with a thick head of dark-gray hair, was wearing a
white polo shirt, cargo shorts, and cheap thong sandals. He laughed and
shuffled to a table by the large path-facing window, where there was a tray
outfitted with a half-full bottle of tuak (a sweet Borneo moonshine brewed from
rice grain) as well as two stacks of small pink-and-white glazed Chinese
teacups. He poured two teacups of the liquor and brought them to Will and
Marin, and then went back to the table and poured himself a cup.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bottoms up,&#148; Will
said, and the three of them shot back their shots.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So this is the <i>Orang
Amerika</i>,&#148; Gandau said. </p>

<p class="Story">Will introduced
Marin to Gandau.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Now, I think we
are friends already, yes?&#148; Gandau said to Marin. &#147;You will love it here,
Marin. The forest is rich with stories and life. The forest <i>is</i> life.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I haven&#8217;t
ventured into the Heart of Darkness?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Light and dark can
get confused out here sometimes,&#148; Gandau said. &#147;My people, the Iban people of
Borneo, used to think that they could ask the spirits to protect them from
confusion, from disease and death. Then they thought they could ask the
government to protect them: send them money, get them into hospitals. After a
couple years of asking the government, now they think they are better off with
the spirits!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, let&#8217;s be
serious,&#148; Gandau said. &#147;It is best to be independent. That is why the O/URC
works so well. We are all independent souls by nature here, us and the
orangutans, so we all understand each other. Don&#8217;t you think, Will?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I never thought
about it like that,&#148; Will said. &#147;That&#8217;s very insightful. I guess that&#8217;s one
thing that we all have in common. Although Marin is here to help us play
better with other, less-independent-minded types.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It can&#8217;t hurt to
have a few more friends in high places, I suppose,&#148; Gandau said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe I&#8217;ll be
wanting to call on the spirits in a few months,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">The door to
Gandau&#8217;s bungalow was open, and there was a call from outside&#151;<i>&#147;Will, are you
in there?&#148;</i> It was Anwar.</p>

<p class="Story">Will stood up and
went to the door. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yep, I&#8217;m still
showing Marin around,&#148; he said. &#147;What&#8217;s up?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wan needs see you
right now,&#148; Anwar said. &#147;He&#8217;s in office.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is there something
wrong?&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Something about
last week ex-cap release,&#148; said Anwar. </p>

<p class="first">Will gave Anwar the names of the remaining
people that he&#8217;d planned to introduce Marin to and asked Anwar to also bring
her to canteen for dinner at seven if he hadn&#8217;t finished with Wan yet. </p>

<p class="Story">Will jogged back to
office, his brain a rattle of protestations and confusion. He
couldn&#8217;t think of any issue that Wan could have had with the release. </p>

<p class="Story">Wan&#8217;s door was
open. The veterinary assistant Dilip was sitting in one of the rattan armchairs in front of Wan&#8217;s desk
with his hands in his lap.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s up?&#148; Will
said. &#147;Anwar said you had a question about last week&#8217;s release?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you remember
Preity being released?&#148; Wan asked. He didn&#8217;t sound angry.</p>

<p class="Story">Preity: a
mild-mannered twelve-year-old ex-cap who had rehabilitated fully and who was
expected to do well on her own in the wild. Had Will seen her that afternoon
in the jungle? Held her up while she shook off the sedation? He couldn&#8217;t say
for certain.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not sure,&#148;
Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Her vitals were logged
before she was put in the crate in the morning, but her tag was not put in the
bag and her vitals were not logged at release that afternoon. It is possible,
likely even, someone on the release team took her.&#148; Wan&#8217;s voice grew more and
more contained as he spoke. </p>

<p class="Story">Will couldn&#8217;t
believe what he was hearing. &#147;That&#8217;s impossible. I mean, first of all,
everyone on the team is trustworthy. Who would have done such a thing?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jo-Jo,&#148; Dilip
said, closing his eyes in pain.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But how? How
could he or anyone else <i>take an orangutan</i> without one of us noticing?&#148;
Will said. &#147;And why are we just figuring it out now?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s what I am
asking you, Will,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will sat down in
the empty armchair next to Dilip. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I messed up,&#148; Will
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We don&#8217;t have any
proof it was Jo-Jo,&#148; said Wan. &#147;However, at all future releases the team
leaders must be more aware. I know how it gets. It isn&#8217;t easy. And we must
have all the crates and tags accounted for before leaving the release site. I
will make sure that Linda, Anwar, Gandau, and the other team leaders know to
keep an eye on Jo-Jo, but I want to keep this quiet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course,&#148; said
Will. &#147;I&#8217;m so, so sorry. You&#8217;re absolutely right.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will asked to see
the release records, and Wan gave them to him. </p>

<p class="Story">Will had meant to
put them on his own desk and then go out and find Marin and finish her
orientation, but he started reading the records in his office and couldn&#8217;t
stop. He double- and triple-checked every notation, counted the tags, and went
over and over the day&#8217;s events again in his head. It was just as Wan had said:
Preity was there on the intake manifest, and nowhere to be found on the
outbound one. </p>

<p class="Story">Two hours had
passed when Will finally had had enough. </p>

<p class="Story">He went to canteen,
which was in semi-shut-down mode already, with lights in half the dining area
shut off and the leftover food set off to one end of the buffet, pastel-colored
mesh tents placed over the plates to keep bugs away. Will served himself fried
chicken and rice and wolfed it down cold in penitence. </p>

<p class="Story">Will washed his
dishes and left canteen. He walked by Marin&#8217;s bungalow on his way home. Her
lights were off. </p>

<p class="last">Climbing the porch
to his own bungalow, Will felt exhausted and world-weary, as if he was the one
who&#8217;d arrived on a twenty-hour flight that afternoon. He passed out on his
bed before changing or brushing his teeth and dreamt that the chorus of cicadas
outside was an army of mail-clad soldiers out to get him for losing Preity. </p>

<p class="first">The next morning, it was light out, and
Will could think more clearly. His only mistake had been trusting Jo-Jo. And
who could have known that Jo-Jo would have betrayed them? </p>

<p class="Story">Will showered in a
daze, preoccupied with hatching crackpot plans for making Jo-Jo confess and
bring Preity back. Will brushed his teeth (twice as long to make up for the
previous night), and changed into clean clothes. </p>

<p class="Story">He walked over to
Marin&#8217;s bungalow two doors down and knocked on the front door. There was no
answer. Will knocked again just as Linda passed by and stopped.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She&#8217;s at canteen,&#148;
she said. </p>

<p class="Story">Will came down off
Marin&#8217;s porch. &#147;Okay, cool,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#8217;ll look for her there.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What happened to
your arm?&#148; Linda asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Will looked down,
and the scrape on his forearm, which had stung a little in the shower, was puffy and red and oozing a dark brown mucus.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I scraped it
yesterday during my hike, but it was fine,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Apparently not,&#148;
Linda said. &#147;I have some stuff in office. I can stitch you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will demurred once
more, but Linda insisted. </p>

<p class="Story">They walked to
office together in an awkward silence. Had Wan told her about Preity yet? </p>

<p class="Story">Linda rarely spent
time in office, as most of her books and equipment were in med, but she did
have a small private office there. In fact, her office was right next door to
Will&#8217;s. They passed by the closed door with the small plastic green sign that
said &#147;Dr. William St. James&#148; in white letters, which sometimes made Will think
of his father. <i>That </i>Dr. William St. James would have not been happy
with him for letting such a nasty infection fester.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda opened her
office door and turned on the light. A stack of white plastic caf&#233; stools
stood by the door. By the window was a bookshelf filled with back issues of
the <i>Journal of Tropical Veterinary Medicine</i>, some frayed textbooks, and
two paperback copies of the C.S. Lewis novel <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>. A
plastic potted plant in the corner badly needed dusting. The only other thing
in the room was a large plastic cabinet on a table. Linda opened both doors to
this cabinet now and ruffled through the bottles, tubes, and pallets on its
shelves.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sit down, Will,&#148;
she said. </p>

<p class="Story">Will lifted the top
stool by its sides, and the other stools came up with it, squeezed stuck into
the top one. Will thrust forcefully downward once, and the bottom two stools
both fell back to the floor with a loud thwack. </p>

<p class="Story">Will set his stool
down in front of the bookshelf and sat down on it, studying the gross infection
on his arm. It looked like an earthworm, dead and washed up in the rain.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know, you
shouldn&#8217;t have been to see the baby ex-caps with an infected cut,&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It wasn&#8217;t infected
yesterday, I swear,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You don&#8217;t think I
understand, but I do.&#148; Linda placed a small bottle of ethyl alcohol on the
table.</p>

<p class="Story">Will thought that
she was talking about Jo-Jo and Preity and was grateful that Linda didn&#8217;t blame
him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She told Si-Chee
at breakfast this morning that she doesn&#8217;t have a boyfriend,&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">It took Will a
moment to realize that &#147;she&#148; was Marin. Will should have anticipated this. Of
course this was what Linda thought! This was what they all thought, probably. He felt bad for Marin for being slotted so quickly by his ignorant coworkers
into the role of his beard, but what could he do? Any insistence to the
contrary would seem suspect. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda had found all
of her supplies now, and she put on a pair of latex gloves, opened the bottle
of alcohol, and wetted a piece of gauze with it. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I worry about you
and Wan and Dilip sometimes,&#148; she said. &#147;Out here, all alone with just apes
and a bunch of crazy people all the time.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">She pressed the wet
gauze to the top edge of Will&#8217;s wound and ran it down the length of the cut
slowly. It felt to Will like she was cutting his arm open, but he wanted
desperately for her not to know that it hurt.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Ben</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">I</span>t had been the most hectic and most
satisfying two months of Ben Blakeman&#8217;s life. He had handled a 65 to 75
percent share of his and Judith&#8217;s wedding preparations, diffused acute flares
of family drama on both sides, continued to put in his regular hours at the
gallery and magazine, been Judith&#8217;s de facto therapist through increasingly
insane Prop 66A fracases, and somehow always found his fourth or fifth wind
when it came time to sit down and work on the &#147;Gil Garcia: G x G&#148; party. </p>

<p class="Story">The Monday after
Ben and Marin&#8217;s first visit to Garcia&#8217;s studio, Ben had finally brought Phillip
into the loop. Garcia had a number of very good antiretroviral drug paintings
in the same vein as the one depicted on his postcard, and his candle pieces
could be integrated into a large altar-like sculpture that could form the
centerpiece of a small solo show. Phillip had seen the work the following
Saturday afternoon and had advised Ben to introduce Garcia to the art world
through an invite-only viewing at Mud23 on the Day of the Dead, November 2
(which of course also just happened to be Judith&#8217;s day of reckoning, election
day). Phillip had included the Garcia viewing as an item on the following
Mud23 staff meeting agenda and had asked everyone to give Ben whatever help he
needed. It was understood that the event was Ben&#8217;s baby. </p>

<p class="Story">In late August,
Garcia had said that he was unhappy with his garage studio and asked if he
could work on the altar at Mud23 in the evenings after he got off work. Phillip said that it was fine as long as Ben was in the office with Garcia
while he worked. Luckily, Ben had already been staying late on his Mud23 days
and coming up after six on most of his MBAD days as well. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben himself cleared
out the workroom for Garcia. Phillip was squeezing the Garcia viewing party in
between two solo shows, so at least there wouldn&#8217;t be a ton of group show
artists coming in and out, and the two solo show artists bookending Garcia were
both low-maintenance.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia fiddled
around with some wood and papier m&#226;ch&#233; constructions, but eventually settled on
wax. Phillip got Garcia access to the boiler in the basement that another
gallery&#8217;s artist had left during a show and never retrieved. Garcia made wax
hands and feet, wax chains, wax sushi, wax crosses, and a wax Jesus. In
September, Garcia finally started working on something that looked like an
altar.</p>

<p class="Story">Meanwhile, Ben
planned the D&#237;a de los Muertos party of the century. His first big task had
been the invitation list. The big local Chicano collectors were a given, but
there were only three. He added his fifteen favorite collectors from Mud23&#8217;s
short list. These fifteen were mainly California philanthropists and
established museum curators and directors&#151;people who had means but also a lot
of knowledge about contemporary art. </p>

<p class="Story">As trained, Ben
prepared thin dossiers for each of these people: a brief bio, with photograph,
net worth, and known preferences (abstract painting, pop art, etc.); most
recent known purchases; previous purchases with Mud23, if any; and any prior
known purchases with similarities to Garcia&#8217;s work. Ben created one page with
a large color image on top and his notes at the bottom for each purchase that
he researched.</p>

<p class="Story">Alone in the office
late one night, Ben did an internet search of the CEO of the internet search
company whose search engine he was using, the phrase <i>&#147;contemporary art,&#148;</i>
and the word <i>&#147;collection.&#148;</i> A <i>Forbes </i>magazine profile came up as
the top hit. Ben clicked on it, skimmed it, and was immediately struck by
these sentences: <i>&#147;His extensive art collection consists mainly of work by
modern art masters such as Picasso and Kandinsky, however the tech pioneer is
interested in finding the artist equivalent of his search engine. He told </i>Forbes<i>:
&#8216;I&#8217;m looking for that visionary contemporary artist whose subject and object is
nothing less than the world, just like our focus has been, from the beginning,
the world and all its information.&#8217;&#148; </i>†Ben printed this out, highlighted
these lines, and put the printout in a dossier folder and added it to his
stack.</p>

<p class="Story">This act unleashed
some aspirational fame beast within Ben. Soon he was looking up musicians, filmmakers, starchitects, and even a few B-list celebrities. Within three
nights, Ben had his thirty-five-person invitation list. He handed the dossiers
to Phillip to review, and Phillip looked through them carefully, without saying
a word about all the new blood. Phillip handed the stack of folders back to
Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good work,&#148; he
said. &#147;So this is going to be like the Hildegard event, right? Or the
Westberg party? It&#8217;s a closed event&#151;not a typical opening. You&#8217;ll need
alcohol and maybe food&#151;something simple that people can carry with them. We
sometimes have music, sometimes live music. However, everything should serve
to add to, not detract from, the work. Ask Angela&#151;she did a good closed event
last year for Arnold Lacey.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben did not need to
ask Angela, whose midlist artists sold to law firms and the unemployed wives of
state university deans. He&#8217;d already decided that there would be no music, and
he was close to convincing a Patr&#243;n publicist to give them twenty bottles of
Patr&#243;n&#8217;s new barrel-aged tequila for free. The invitation design would be
simple: black and white, with three skulls in the corner; a few clean lines of
text indicating the essential information; and a two-line bio for Garcia: <i>&#147;The
artist is the son of a former muralista who is now living homeless in the East
Bay. Diagnosed with HIV in 1997, he explores life, death, inheritance, and
pharmaceuticals in an exclusive D&#237;a de los Muertos viewing at Mud23.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Some of Ben&#8217;s
gallery coworkers were surprised that he had taken on so much of the wedding
planning, but Judith was just as busy&#151;the polling numbers on Prop 66A were in a
dead heat with election day five weeks away&#151;and her work was much more
important.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith and Ben now
spoke in a shorthand that was vaudevillian in both its pacing and deployment of
tongue twisters. A sample of a typical recent conversation:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Did you finish
the song list?</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: Gabe isn&#8217;t on
board yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Bullshit.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: That&#8217;s what I
said. I&#8217;m on it, don&#8217;t worry.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Okay, music is
you. Hit me if you need me.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: How was
Strat-Sesh?</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Low on strat,
high on sesh. There&#8217;s something we&#8217;re missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: 66A is trending
pro. Red or blue&#151;nobody likes drug reps.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Back to wedding:
minor table dilemma. There&#8217;s more MV than anticipated.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: But those people
never leave New England.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: That&#8217;s what you
said when we put them all on the guest list.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: How many MVs
RSVP-yeses (with guests)?</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Eighteen.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: Sheesh. Did
anyone RSVP &#147;no&#148; to this wedding?</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: My uncle John.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:3.0pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Ben</u>: Isn&#8217;t he dead?</p>

<p style="margin:0;text-indent:0;text-align:left"><u>Judith</u>: Yes. We need more deaths. </p>

</div>

<p class="last">Their apartment,
predictably, was a mess. Probably the only organized space in the entire place
was a closet in their bedroom which held Judith&#8217;s strapless white gown and
Ben&#8217;s tuxedo in zipped-up garment bags, a bottle of scotch and two plastic
cups, a bag of organic dried apricots, a package of salmon jerky, two packed
duffel bags, and a bright blue Tiffany&#8217;s bag.</p>

<p class="first">Ben awoke the morning of the wedding to a
gentle poking on his shoulder. Judith was propped up next to him, her hair in
disarray. The clock beside her said <i>&#147;5:30 AM.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello, groom,&#148; she
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello, bride,&#148; he
said. He kissed her on the lips and brushed a stray eyelash from her right
cheek. He felt safe, wanted, ready.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s have sex now
before our 163 guests descend upon us,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">It happened for
both of them quickly&#151;the clock said thirteen minutes. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith smiled
wickedly. &#147;We&#8217;re two minutes ahead of schedule,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben knew that she
wasn&#8217;t joking, that at some point before this morning Judith had scheduled, if
only in her head, five-thirty to five-forty-five of the morning of their
wedding day for sex, and he found this incredibly endearing. He stood up,
stretched, and raised his hand to her in a high-five. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re going to be
the best marriage ever,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Well, <i>duh</i>,&#148;
Judith said. She slapped his palm like a frat boy, pinched his bare butt
cheek, and went into the bathroom to brush her teeth.</p>

<p class="first">The wedding ceremony was scheduled for
three in the afternoon at the Mandala Women&#8217;s Refugee Center rooftop garden, to
be followed by cocktails, a reception dinner, and dancing at Anastasia
Richards&#8217; brother Gabriel&#8217;s restaurant/lounge in nearby SOMA, QWERTY. </p>

<p class="Story">The Mandala Center
was a four-floor building that took up the entirety of one of the large
triangle-shaped blocks formed by the imperfect intersection of the city&#8217;s two
main grids. Its rooftop had been turned by the Center&#8217;s clients and volunteer
staff into one of San Francisco&#8217;s prettiest urban gardens over the
past several years. Pots of yellow blazing star lined one end of the roof. Morning glory climbed lattice archways over square Japanese-style planters of
orange California poppies. Walnut and avocado trees shed their leaves around
sage and gooseberry plants planted into long soil-filled grooves in the roof
floor. </p>

<p class="Story">The Blakeman-Lam
wedding would be the first non-Mandala event in the garden, but BAARC&#8217;s
immigrant rights group had done a lot for the Mandala Center (and Judith had
logged many volunteer hours there in her free time, as a Mandarin-English
translator) and she and Ben had been able to rent the space for next to
nothing. </p>

<p class="Story">That morning, as
Ben and Judith showered, gathered their things, and poured coffee into aluminum
thermoses, 104 white folding chairs were set up in short rows along the wide
stone walkway that ran along the length of the Mandala Center roof. These
would be first-come-first-serve, and the other fifty-six guests would stand in
the smaller concrete paths that ran throughout the gardens. BAARC&#8217;s CEO,
Deepna Rasjani, was officiating the ceremony.</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge was Ben&#8217;s
best man, and Anastasia Richards was Judith&#8217;s maid of honor. Ben
had mixed feelings about Judith&#8217;s best friend. Anastasia was an incredibly
bright, successful, loyal (especially to Judith), occasionally very funny woman
whose worldview had been somewhat warped by her cushy expat upbringing. She
was one of those women who attributed her scarcity of women friends to other
women&#8217;s jealousy of her.</p>

<p class="Story">However, it was a point of pride for Ben that Anastasia still liked him&#151;a lot. The complexity of their relationship was an important signal of something for Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith and Ben were
to get ready in conference rooms on different floors at the Mandala Center. As
soon as they pulled into the Center&#8217;s small parking lot, Anastasia ran out and
took Judith&#8217;s gown and bag from the back seat. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Say your goodbyes,&#148; Anastasia said, beaming as broadly as if that day was her wedding day, not theirs. &#147;The next time you&#8217;ll be seeing each other will be
as <i>bride</i> and <i>groom</i>!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;See ya groom,&#148;
Judith said. She kissed him on the cheek and opened the car door. &#147;I&#8217;ll tell
Jorge you&#8217;re here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, he&#8217;s
studying for a test in the groom&#8217;s room,&#148; Anastasia said. &#147;I told him, &#8216;Don&#8217;t
worry! Law is all just b.s., and you&#8217;re a good bullshitter.&#8217; He&#8217;s so
competitive, though.&#148; </p>

<p class="last">Judith got out of
the car, and she and Anastasia slammed their car doors shut and walked to the
Center&#8217;s back entrance together chatting rapidly. Ben got out and got his
stuff from the back seat, his heart racing a little as he draped the tuxedo
garment bag on his arm. This was it. It was starting: the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="first">Jorge was wearing
his dress shirt and pants and was deeply absorbed in some one-hundred-year-old
caselaw when Ben opened the door to the Mandala Center conference room that they
were using as the groom&#8217;s room and peeked in.</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge smiled, put
his hands to his mouth, and trumpeted the opening notes of <i>Here Comes the
Bride</i>: <i>doo, doo, da-doo!</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, yeah, yeah,&#148;
Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure you
don&#8217;t need me for the wedding march?&#148; Jorge asked. &#147;I also do a pretty bad ass
piccolo.&#148; Jorge bunched up his fingers to the right of his mouth, pursed his
lips tightly, and wiggled his fingers up and down rapidly.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed. &#147;Very
kind of you to offer your considerable talents, but I think we&#8217;re good on the
music front,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben got dressed,
and Jorge returned to his studying. Ben was tying his bowtie when Jorge
finally looked up again.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben!&#148; Jorge said. &#147;What the eff? You&#8217;re going to make me cry, in your little tuxedo. Shit.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jorge.&#148; Ben sat
down in the chair next to his friend. &#147;I don&#8217;t know why exactly Stanford put
us in that tiny Otero double together six years ago&#133;&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh,<i> thanks</i>,&#148;
Jorge said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But I know that I
wouldn&#8217;t have gotten to a place where I was ready to do this if it hadn&#8217;t been
for your friendship,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Do you remember that talk that we had after
you came out to your parents?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge&#8217;s mother was
a devout Catholic, and his father was a diehard Republican with some social
conservative beliefs.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, of course,&#148;
Jorge said. &#147;You said that me figuring out the kind of person that I want to
love could not disappoint someone who truly loves me and understands love.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you said,
&#8216;Ben, logic has nothing to do with the desire to be loved unconditionally,&#8217;&#148;
Ben said. &#147;And we had this amazing debate about the evolution of human feeling
and found families versus biological ones. I always think about the things
that we said that night when I&#8217;m trying to figure out a relationship issue. It
was just, and your friendship is, very special to me.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Jorge quickly wiped
away a single tear from the corner of his eye and sucked wet snot back into his
nose. &#147;Oh, you&#8217;re good.&#148; He almost looked scared of Ben.</p>

<p class="last">They hugged.</p>

<p class="first">It was a sunny, cool sixty-eight degrees as
a solo violinist bowed out a blissful, summery arrangement of <i>With a Little
Help From My Friends</i>, and Judith&#8217;s spry seventy-something father walked
his only child through the garden of guests and California native greenery on
the roof of the Mandala Women&#8217;s Refugee Center towards Ben. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had on first
consideration thought that the traditional white dress would be too clich&#233; for
Judith, but he should have known better. No dress, not even a white wedding
gown, could overwhelm this woman. Judith was exactly, intensely, who she was
at all times. What you saw was what you got, and Ben smiled to be reminded of
this quality of hers again as she walked to him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good job,&#148; he
whispered as he took her hand.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks,&#148; she said,
and laughed. </p>

<p class="Story">Deepna was a
wonderful officiator and gave the proceedings a subtle personal touch here and
there. Judith and Ben had written simple vows and read them to each other. Their mothers both cried. They exchanged rings, and that was that. Within
minutes&#151;Ben had waited for buses longer&#151;it was over, and he was walking Judith
back down the aisle to applause and camera flashes from his guests. </p>

<p class="last">Even though Ben had
gone through the guest list so many times with Judith; had had dinner with
Jorge, Anastasia, and his and Judith&#8217;s families the night before; and had
rushed through the crowd of guests briefly while looking for Deepna before the
ceremony; he was still surprised to see such a dense collection of familiar
faces, all looking at him and Judith, squinting through the viewfinders of
single lens-reflex cameras at them, and smiling. People from all stages of his
life: his parents&#8217; friends from Martha&#8217;s Vineyard, his high school gang, the
college crew (Max! Marin! Nazneen was smiling wryly), his and Judith&#8217;s San Francisco
friends, his Mud23 and MBAD coworkers (Honor Lewis, wearing an unflattering
floral sundress, was resting her head on Billy Earhardt&#8217;s shoulder&#151;they had
become a couple in February&#151;as Billy took a picture of the newlyweds). Ben
held on tighter to Judith&#8217;s arm and smiled and waved back.</p>

<p class="first">The reception was a zoo when Judith and Ben
arrived for the last ten minutes of cocktail hour. </p>

<p class="Story">Although Gabe
Richards was a rising star in the San Francisco Bay Area food world, to Judith
he would always be the black sheep of the Richards family. It wasn&#8217;t just that
Gabe had been a poor student and had never finished college. His parents, according to Judith, would have happily and actively encouraged a son
that was a budding artist, musician, poet, or chef with C&#8217;s in algebra. But
there had also been hard drugs and an expensive stint in rehab. Gabe had had
an intense, codependent three-year relationship with a suicidal girl in high
school&#151;which had ended when the girl&#8217;s father had forbidden her from seeing
him&#151;and now sourced his steady stream of casual girlfriends primarily from his
own pool of employees. This, in fact, was the most unforgivable of Gabe&#8217;s
offenses to his father, who himself was widely credited with establishing the
Pac Development Bank&#8217;s sophisticated sexual harassment reporting procedures all
the way back in the eighties. Finally, and perhaps most infamously, was the
persistent rumor that one of the financial backers of Gabe&#8217;s first restaurant
in New York had had &#147;Italian mob connections.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Still, there was no
denying Gabe Richards&#8217; talent as a restaurateur. His newest establishment,
QWERTY, was a work of art. To enter its spacious interior was to walk inside a
beautiful antique typewriter. McCool No. 2 and Remington Standard 2 keys and
type baskets had been blown up to scale and carefully reproduced, dried
black ink stains and all. These elements jutted out from the pewter-plated
walls, black ceiling, and black granite floors in an attentive and busy fashion
that at certain angles recalled the dark interior of a gothic cathedral. Best
of all, there were twenty-six bottles of house wine that rested, cork-side-in,
in a wine rack built into the wall whose vertical cross-section was shaped like
a keyboard. The bottoms of the wine bottles were locked into specially
designed cups that each had a different letter of the alphabet printed on it,
and they were arranged in the wine rack according to their position on a QWERTY
keyboard layout. One ordered one&#8217;s wine by letter, of course, e.g. <i>&#147;I&#8217;ll
have a glass of G, please.&#148;</i> That night, in honor of Judith and Ben, half
of the bottles were J&#8217;s (a nice shiraz) and the other half were B&#8217;s (a dry
chardonnay).</p>

<p class="Story">Judith and Ben&#8217;s
guests were eating it up, and letting themselves go a little too loose, too
early because of it. Jorge must have noticed this too, because, without
instruction, he took the microphone at five to seven and asked everyone to find
their tables and be seated. </p>

<p class="Story">Dinner was served:
green mango and arugula salad; entrees of turbot, lamb, or stuffed acorn
squash; and sides of grilled asparagus and QWERTY&#8217;s famous black-and-white
rice. The lemon coconut wedding cake was sliced up unceremoniously and served
with vanilla ice cream for dessert. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben looked around
himself at all of the tables that for weeks had been first initials and last
names on a diagram. A freewheeling tensionlessness characterized every table&#8217;s
proceedings except his own, worrying him. Mud23 people were wiping away tears
from laughing at something that Phillip was saying. There were several red
faces at the Martha&#8217;s Vineyard tables. One of Judith&#8217;s cousins had taken off
her shoes and put them on her table. Max and Marin&#151;whose drama-less breakup
five years ago and ensuing civility had never fooled Ben&#151;were holding onto the
backs of each other&#8217;s chairs laughing about something. Even Honor Lewis&#151;who
had told Ben repeatedly how much she hated all Gabe Richards establishments&#151;had
cleaned every teaspoon of edible substance off of her plates and looked visibly stoned.</p>

<p class="Story">At
seven-fifty-five, waiters circulated the room pouring champagne. At eight,
Jorge stood, went to the mic, and rang his fork against his champagne flute. The room quieted, and Jorge smiled.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There are some
songs that make you believe in love,&#148; he said. &#147;We know we shouldn&#8217;t trust
them. They&#8217;re written by drug addicts and crazy people. They even rhyme, for
god&#8217;s sake.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">People laughed, and
Judith and Ben looked at each other and kissed once on the lips.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But imagine, for a
minute, a world without love songs. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a world that anyone
wants to live in. I know I certainly don&#8217;t, and The Cure cost me three months
of my life that I will never get back.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen yelped
loudly: she was now the drunkest one at a very drunk table. Jorge was
referencing his last relationship, with an extremely attractive champion
mind-game player. Jorge blamed the relationship entirely on the song <i>Friday,
I&#8217;m in Love</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Judith and Ben are
like a really good love song,&#148; Jorge continued. &#147;Something about them seems a
little too good to be true&#151;they&#8217;re too good-looking, too smart, too much fun,
too bold, too generous&#151;they must have been created by a crazy person in a
digital studio somewhere. Seeing them, the way they support each other and
complete each other every day in little ways and big ways, makes me believe in
love. Which scares me and makes me kind of hate them. A lot.&#148; Ben put his
arm around Judith, and Jorge turned and looked at them. He said, &#147;Except, I
wouldn&#8217;t want to live in a world where Judith and Ben and their love for each
other didn&#8217;t exist. And, unlike a good love song, Ben and Judith will pour you
a glass of wine and make fun of your ex for you after a bad breakup. So
there&#8217;s no losing with them, really. To Ben and Judith.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Everyone raised
their flutes and drank, and Ben and Judith got up to hug and thank Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I love you guys,&#148;
Jorge said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re the shit,
Jorge,&#148; Judith said, smiling and holding Jorge&#8217;s hand in hers for one long
second.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You really are,&#148;
Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">Then, Anastasia
stood and walked to the mic with her champagne flute as Ben, Judith, and Jorge
took their seats again. <i>Please just make it boring, </i>Ben thought, <i>please,
God, just make her boring. </i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Judith and I grew
up together,&#148; Anastasia said. &#147;We&#8217;re like sisters. At one time, I think that
I thought that I <i>was</i> the Lams&#8217; adopted daughter.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">People laughed, and
Ben relaxed.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;I&#8217;ve met all of
her boyfriends, and frankly I&#8217;ve never thought that any one of them was good
enough for her until Ben showed up. The other guys were all perfectly
adequate&#151;perfectly attractive and successful and smart and good at things, but
Judith Lam is in a class by herself. In times like these, when the major
political agents of this country seem to have forgotten what common sense is,
Judith&#8217;s there every day quietly putting heart and soul back into public
service. And so, the first time I met Ben, let me say: he just shone. He
was&#151;is&#151;a star. And I thought, &#8216;Yes, finally, someone whose light shines as
brightly as my Judith.&#8217; To the new two-star constellation of Ben and Judith.&#148; She raised her glass and smiled prettily even as tears started forming in her
eyes. &#147;Welcome to the family, Ben.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Ben&#8217;s parents had been a power couple. Kert Blakeman and Elizabeth Rubicoff had met at Harvard Law School in the
seventies. Harvard Law was the penultimate step in separately-hatched but
nearly-identical ten-year-plans made after Martin Luther King&#8217;s assassination
(when Kert and Elizabeth were both eighteen). They were known by their class,
and even most teachers, as a single unit of interest: &#147;Kert and Liz.&#148; People
wondered what &#147;Kert and Liz&#148; had thought of Friday&#8217;s exam, where &#147;Kert and Liz&#148;
were planning on working for the summer, when and where &#147;Kert and Liz&#148; wanted
to prepare for mock trial. </p>

<p class="Story">When they
graduated, they set up a small criminal defense practice in D.C. Through the
simple act of competent legal representation the Blakemans would protect
repentant juveniles from a racist system that (if unchecked) would imprison
them despite the marginality of their legal and moral transgressions. </p>

<p class="Story">The next four years
confirmed everything Kert and Liz had always believed about good and evil (that
there&#8217;s a little bit of both in all of us), power (that it corrupts), the
oppressed (that the most powerless are capable of the greatest dignity),
government, politics, and media. Where they were caught off guard was how
tired it all made them. By year four, Kert realized that he hadn&#8217;t read a
novel in over fifteen months. Liz had two drawers full of recipes that she had
clipped and never gotten to try. Neither of them could make it to six o&#8217;clock
without serious multiple intakes of caffeine.</p>

<p class="Story">So they gave up
law. They moved to Martha&#8217;s Vineyard. They ran an inn. </p>

<p class="Story">They danced now at
their son&#8217;s wedding reception: a little swing, a little freestyle. They were
as deeply in love as the day they had met.</p>

<p class="last">Meanwhile, Ben and
Judith quickly broke down a guest greeting strategy: they would swing left
first, towards Judith&#8217;s BAARC coworkers and other activist friends standing
near the bar; then hang to the left of the dance floor and talk to the table of
Judith&#8217;s family friends from Cupertino and the two tables of Judith&#8217;s relatives
from Taiwan; split up on the dance floor and dance with their school and city
friends and cousins there; join up again and spend time with the Mud23 and MBAD
tables and the table of Judith&#8217;s med school friends on the other side; visit
with the Martha&#8217;s Vineyard table and table of older Blakemans and Rubicoffs
near the doors before they left for the night; split up and try to talk to any
stragglers that they had missed; and then meet up on the dance floor to get the
energy going there again for the last hour of the party.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People see what
they want to see. A simple smear campaign, especially a disingenuous one,
can&#8217;t define an entire election.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It can when it&#8217;s a
five-point election and a wartime election and a smear campaign architected to
turn a war hero candidate&#8217;s war record against him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What the hell is a
swiftboat, anyway?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Judith&#8217;s coworkers
and activist friends were all extremely drunk. The activisterati of San
Francisco was wasted. After a few drinks, their coffee shop vocabularies,
their Chomskyesque analyses, and their obsession (hate so intense it resembled
love at times) with the Trojan horse tactics and neocon agenda of the Bush administration
overcame the weariness of overuse and emerged with renewed vigor. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A swiftboat is an
aluminum, fifty-feet-long, shallow-draft fast patrol craft operated by the
American Brown Water Navy for counterinsurgency operations during the Vietnam
War,&#148; Judith said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I knew that she
would know the answer to that,&#148; a BAARC strategist said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;&#8216;Know the weather
and know the ground and your victory will be complete,&#8217;</i>&#148; a director of a
progressive fundraising outfit named Howie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I hate Sun Tzu,&#148; a
woman named Phyl said. &#147;<i>The Art of War</i> is just one long asinine nursery
rhyme. I&#8217;ll bet it even rhymes in Chinese. Watch, I&#8217;ll write a book that
unearths the hidden meanings behind &#8216;The Old Woman in a Shoe,&#8217; and people will
eat that up the exact same way.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh Phyl, you&#8217;re so
cynical,&#148; Judith said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re right. I
should be more like you,&#148; Phyl said. &#147;You don&#8217;t have illusions about people,
but you&#8217;re never cynical. How do you do it?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sleep,&#148; said Ben. &#147;That&#8217;s her secret. Seven hours a night, every night.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Only Judith Lam
could sleep so well, knowing the things she knows about the medical system in
this country,&#148; the BAARC strategist said.</p>

<p class="Story">They all laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">Howie was checking
email on his PDA and suddenly his left arm shot straight up as he peered closer
in to look at the device&#8217;s tiny screen in his other hand. &#147;Oh, jesus christ. My director of donor relationships wants to know if it&#8217;s <i>okay</i> to move
Elizabeth Edwards&#8217; fundraising dinner to a smaller room. Since when is it ever
<i>okay</i> to move a fundraising dinner to a smaller room? You sell the
tables you&#8217;re given!&#148; He laughed incredulously.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just ignore her,&#148;
Judith said. &#147;That&#8217;s what I do when people ask silly questions.&#148; She smiled.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, well I
wouldn&#8217;t talk to anybody on my staff for days if I did that,&#148; Howie said. &#147;But
yeah, you&#8217;re right. Forget Sun Tzu and the old shoe woman, Judith Lam is all
you need.&#148; He laughed again. He picked up his sweaty glass of scotch from the
bar and downed its liquid contents.</p>

<p class="last">Judith&#8217;s political
friends were not, on paper, the most inspiring bunch to be around. However,
they all knew and loved Judith, and based on that alone, Ben kind of loved
them.</p>

<p class="first">People who hadn&#8217;t danced in years were
dancing. Men for whom moving rhythmically to music had been an act
successfully avoided through slow chewing and strategically-timed bathroom
breaks at many previous weddings were moving around with gusto on the
250-square-foot space in QWERTY&#8217;s lounge that had been cleared for dancing. White-haired family friends who sometimes had trouble remembering what day it
was found that they could remember the steps to the foxtrots and jives that
they had danced at their own weddings.</p>

<p class="Story">After finishing
their first table rounds, Ben danced with Judith for a little bit, then they
split up as planned and he found his high school friends: Cal, the investment
banker; Heather, the fashion designer; Keiko, the journalist; and Wilbur, the
med school student. All four lived in New York; all four were still single. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben suspected that
some amount of luck was involved in the business of coupling, but&#151;he couldn&#8217;t
help it&#151;he found most single people slightly pathetic since he had gotten
engaged, even his friends. They seemed so lost: making pro/con lists, putting
up with so much awkwardness and bad behavior, over-analyzing dates with and
mixed messages from people who (to Ben) seemed to have no interest in anything
serious.</p>

<p class="Story">Heather, Cal,
Keiko, and Wilbur had gotten close again over the past two years, and they saw
each other all the time in New York. They had some inside jokes now that Ben
wasn&#8217;t a part of, and every other sentence one of them said contained the words
&#147;in New York.&#148; Even though he had been through a lot with them, and in some
ways they knew him better than anyone else in the world, he was also glad that
he&#8217;d moved on. </p>

<p class="Story">He felt generous
tonight, felt that his friends would find what they were looking for
eventually. Everyone just moved at their own pace.</p>

<p class="last">Dancing with his
old clique, Ben looked back at his bride. Judith&#8217;s glossy black hair was still
pulled back in a neat chignon. She held the skirt of her dress in both hands,
danced to the eighties song that was playing, and laughed. He didn&#8217;t know how
he&#8217;d gotten so lucky, how he&#8217;d skipped all of the angst and confusion of his
age bracket and gone straight to the good stuff.</p>

<p class="first">Ben had promised himself that he wouldn&#8217;t
think about Garcia on his wedding day, but he kept editing the &#147;Gil Garcia: G x
G&#148; plans in his head. Ben and Judith&#8217;s wedding cake baker was famous for her
miniature pastel tres leches cakes that came in cardboard jewelry boxes, with
edible gold-covered chocolate rings inside. Ben didn&#8217;t know why he hadn&#8217;t put
two and two together before. He was certain that he could get the baker to do
a special version of the jewelry box pastel tres leches for the Garcia party.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith and Ben
finished dancing, joined up again, and made their remaining table rounds,
taking pictures with and making small talk with dozens more guests. When
they&#8217;d finished their last table, the reception&#8217;s population had thinned out by
about a third, but the energy in the restaurant had increased in both volume
and tempo. </p>

<p class="Story">Additionally, groups had begun to intermingle: Judith&#146;s friends Howie and Phyl were talking to Max by the bar; Ben&#146;s high school friends Heather and Keiko were dancing with some guys that Ben worked with at MBAD; one of Ben&#8217;s cousins was talking to Phillip and Angela from Mud23; Nazneen was flirting with a divorced med school classmate of Judith&#8217;s; Anastasia Richards&#8217;s date Jeff was talking about god-knows-what with Ben&#8217;s high school friend Wilbur; Anastasia herself seemed to be everywhere all at once; two couples from Judith and Ben&#8217;s San Francisco friend group and a couple from Judith&#8217;s med school group were in deep discussion about something that involved diagrams drawn on cocktail napkins at
an empty table in the back&#133;</p>

<p class="Story">And Marin, Becky,
Jorge, Max&#8217;s sister Jessie, and one of Judith&#8217;s cousins came out from the
kitchen and gathered behind the bar in a semicircle around Gabe Richards. Gabe
appeared to be giving them all some kind of tour. He also appeared to be
placing his hand on the square of Marin&#8217;s back a lot. All of them laughed at
something that Gabe said and came back out from behind the bar, near where Max,
Howie, and Phyl were talking.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Water, babe?&#148;
Judith asked Ben. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben nodded, and
they walked, holding hands, to the bar. Ben noticed Marin go out of her way to
physically separate herself from Gabe.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben called out to him, &#147;Hey Gabriel, man, where are the glasses?&#148; Ben pointed to the water fountain, mimed drinking, and pointed to Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">Gabe came over and
got two glasses out of a cabinet. He quickly filled them with ice and opened a
bottle of French mineral water and filled each glass with an inch-and-a-half of
mineral water. Ben joined him behind the bar.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks, man,&#148; Ben
said. He handed one glass over the counter of the bar to Judith, who was now
deep in conversation with Jorge and Jessie. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Having fun?&#148; Gabe
asked Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben took a big
drink of water, and wanted to swim in it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can&#8217;t complain,&#148;
Ben said. &#147;We owe you big time.&#148; Gabe had waived QWERTY&#8217;s venue fee and given
Ben and Judith a 30% discount on the price per person.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you kidding?&#148;
Gabe said. &#147;How else was I going to rub the dissolute obscenities of my
proletariat successes in my parents&#8217; faces?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had the urge
to, like Marin, physically separate himself from Gabe. Luckily, Howie and
Phyl came over at that moment and introduced themselves to Gabe, complimenting
him on his place and his food. Ben left them and joined Becky and Max in front
of the bar just as Nazneen marched up to them regally as if she&#8217;d been
summoned.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where&#8217;d Chookie
go?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bathroom,&#148; Becky
and Max said in unison.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That girl has a bladder the size of a
peanut,&#148; said Nazneen. &#147;Remember that time we went to the Foothills and she
kept stopping every fifteen minutes to pee in the bushes?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We used to plan pee breaks for her into
our dates,&#148; Max said. &#147;I think it&#8217;s because her dad used to experiment with
his Fenniskrante meds on her when she was young. He messed up her kidneys or
something.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Dr. Choo&#8217;s coming in two weeks for a drug
launch thingie, so you can ask him about that yourself, if you want,&#148; said
Nazneen. &#147;I think they&#8217;re trying to nip this whole thing in California in the
bud.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, well they&#8217;re
wasting time in California. Everyone I know is voting &#8216;pro&#8217; on 66A,&#148; Max
said. &#147;The stories Marin used to tell me about what her father does&#133; Even
now, they&#8217;re so frikking arrogant. Marin said that all the big drug companies
are calling the state propositions the &#8216;D.A.R.E. bills&#8217;&#151;doesn&#8217;t that make them
drug dealers? I don&#8217;t get it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;&#8216;<i>I don&#8217;t get it</i>,&#8217;&#148;
Nazneen repeated, in a high-pitched and whiny voice that did not sound at all
like Max&#8217;s.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Real mature, Naz,&#148;
Max said.</p>

<p class="Story">She laughed a very
mean laugh.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I want to
live here,&#148; Becky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re moving
back?&#148; Ben said. &#147;I thought you got a job in New York.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not San
Francisco,&#148; Becky said. &#147;Here: QWERTY.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed. Becky
could be sweet and funny like that sometimes. He&#8217;d forgotten.</p>

<p class="Story">A great song came
on then, a song that both Ben&#8217;s and Judith&#8217;s generations liked to claim as
their own. One by one, they were drawn back to the dance floor by the long
farrow memories that the song inspired. The entire party gathered on the dance floor,
drawn first by the song and then because that&#8217;s where the party was. They
shook limbs and heads and anything else that could be shaken. They sang along
with the chorus with their eyes closed. They danced their silliest moves
during the bridge. </p>

<p class="Story">It was ridiculous
how easy it all was, how little trade-off there was to receive so much. And
Ben finally realized that this was it&#151;no shoe was going to drop, nothing bad
was going to happen. Everyone had blessed their union, had eaten and drunk
with abandon, and now they were going to dance, just like he and his wife had
planned for months.</p>

<h2>Sarawak : 2003</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he first time that Marin heard Captain
Kirk&#8217;s long call, she was in bed. It was one in the morning. The O/URC campus was quiet,
and it was dark. Marin had been asleep for three hours, dreaming that she was
in an American supermarket in the Borneo jungle&#151;trying to shop for food for the
ex-caps, but everything had palm oil in it&#151;and then one moment she wasn&#8217;t
asleep anymore. As soon as she heard the call she knew what it was, even
though she was still learning about the orangutans in fits and starts. </p>

<p class="Story">A deep wail sounded
far off in the jungle&#151;not human, but not purely animal. It sustained and then
changed, the source moving lower into the loose, hung bag of a throat that it
came from. Hearing this sound transformed something material within Marin, and
then she had a thickening fear of and respect for its owner, without ever
having laid eyes on him. The call echoed for a long time. </p>

<p class="Story">If Marin was to
succeed in the task that she had been brought to the O/URC to accomplish, then
she would have to effect a similar miracle of transformation in very distant,
and far less receptive, creatures than herself. Wan had been on the right
track when he had suggested coming up with a narrative, but that wasn&#8217;t
enough. They needed people&#8217;s attention and trust as well. Otherwise, any
narrative, no matter how compelling, was pretty easy to ignore. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had
one-and-a-half months left on her Soames Fellowship, and she&#8217;d spent all of her
time in Borneo so far doing leg work: she&#8217;d assembled a large database of
names and phone numbers; she&#8217;d researched all of the target individuals
in-depth on the internet; she&#8217;d utilized her few good contacts from her Pac
days to fill in the blanks here and there. Now it was time to do the real
work: convincing (how many was enough, exactly?) these busy people that some
apes and trees in a part of the world that they had never been to was a cause
worth spending their time, resources, and professional reputations on, and that
was before mentioning that this cause involved stalling or reversing the growth
of a billion-dollar industry.</p>

<p class="Story">It sounded
impossible most days, but it wasn&#8217;t as if there weren&#8217;t precedents.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin missed
things: guacamole; pupating in a cocoon of three blankets during cold San
Francisco nights; neighborhood coffee shops on weekday mornings, the mix of
hurry and slumber, the menus written in chalk on the wall. On the other side
of the scale, there was this place, the orangutans, and Will. </p>

<p class="Story">Will had irritated
her that day he&#8217;d come to Pac&#151;he was smart, impassioned, and articulate, and it
had seemed to Marin at the time that he was wasting his talents on this
orangutan business. She&#8217;d been under Ray Marcos&#8217;s influence at the time, and
the influence of sneakily persistent mainstream notions about success. </p>

<p class="Story">In Borneo, however,
knowing Will was like watching a magician whose every trick seems like his best trick. It was just
a joy to watch Will be Will. He knew so much and did everything so well,
whether switching cage assignments to suddenly solve an orangutan&#8217;s chronic
diarrhea problem or clapping his hands in such a way as to make five macaques
leave six cups of rice uneaten on the ground and disappear into the jungle.</p>

<p class="Story">In fact, everyone
at the O/URC seemed endlessly informed and skillful. Marin had thought that
she knew what it was like to be surrounded by intimidating people, but each of
her new coworkers had a purity of purpose and an accumulation of practical
accomplishment that had the potential to be far more damaging to a person&#8217;s
self-confidence than either Stanford&#8217;s student body of sardonic over-achievers
or Pac&#8217;s systematically overworked and underutilized braintrust; big ponds and
small ponds notwithstanding. Wan, Will, Linda, Anwar, and Gandau were each
brilliant about things that Marin hadn&#8217;t even known one could be brilliant
about, but perhaps even more impressive was how every other staff member at the
O/URC, from the canteen cook to the grounds staff, had made this place and the
orangutans their life and their world so completely and with such ease. </p>

<p class="last">Poor
Marin had been spoiled into the most ordinary kinds of excellence by her
middle-class suburban American upbringing. She could play <i>F&#252;r Elise</i> by
memory and write an A-quality eight-page paper on Kantian ethics in one night,
but when it came to walking three hours in the tropics without turning into a
sweaty mess, fixing a leak in a bungalow roof, or improvising a cure for a
sinus headache from a few herbs pulled from the jungle, Marin Choo was sorely
behind the curve.</p>

<p class="first">Marin and Will were supposed to go on a
hike in Section A that morning, so Marin got up at five-thirty, showered in the
women&#8217;s bathroom, and changed into hiking clothes. She massaged mosquito
repellant and sunblock into her exposed skin. Her body seemed to change from
morning to morning: one day it felt taut and strong and beautiful, as
impenetrable to the perils of the tropics as Anwar&#8217;s or Gandau&#8217;s; at other
times it seemed fussy and unreliable, capable of grotesque betrayals, another
thing for her to be vigilant about. </p>

<p class="Story">She went to
canteen. Breakfast was the most social meal at the O/URC. For lunch, people
ate in the field or ran to canteen and shoveled some food into their mouths and
went back to work. People got into strange schedules over the course of the
day and dinners were staggered, with people eating as early as five and as late
as ten. However, from six-thirty to eight o&#8217;clock in the morning each day,
everyone converged upon canteen; drinking tea and coffee; eating toast, fried
eggs, chicken congee, and fresh fruit; gossiping, joking around, and chatting
optimistically about their plans for the day ahead.</p>

<p class="Story">Canteen was a large
wood building, built in a traditional Malay style, with a peaked roof, a long
porch in front, and full-length windows all along the three exterior walls of
the dining room, which were left open most of the time. Sturdy hardwood tables
filled the dining room, along with white plastic chairs and stools. Three
large ceiling fans spun during breakfast and peak lunch and dinner hours. The
clean and airy kitchen at the back was the domain of a busy staff of three: the
cook, a Chinese-Malaysian woman named May, and her two nieces, Lee and Wen. </p>

<p class="Story">Will was eating
with Anwar and the O/URC&#146;s botanist Si-Chee. Anwar and Si-Chee were hiking together in Section B after breakfast. Marin put her backpack down by an empty seat at their table, and went to the
buffet to get her food. She picked up a brown tray, ladled congee from the
soup pot into a chipped bowl, grabbed a yellow banana from the pile of fruit,
and selected a white mug with a drawing of a mountain and &#147;I Climbed Kota
Kinabalu!&#148; printed on the side. She held it under the spout of the coffee
thermos and pushed down on the big round plastic button on top. Brown instant
coffee peed into the mug. Marin swatted some flies away from her congee and
brought her tray over to Will&#8217;s table.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve got to get a
new water bottle,&#148; Si-Chee said, poking the scratched pink copolyester plastic
of a 24-ounce sport drinking bottle.</p>

<p class="Story">Si-Chee was leaving the O/URC in a few weeks to finish and defend
her Ph.D. dissertation in Singapore. She was getting married one week after
her graduate school graduation, to a fellow Singaporean who had gotten his Ph.D. in
some kind of engineering from Rice University and was now working for a medical
device manufacturer in Houston. Si-Chee was going to move to Houston with him
after a brief honeymoon in Phuket.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;ll not
drinking water anymore in Texas,&#148; Anwar said. &#147;In Texas, they only drinking
beer and Coca-Cola.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And margaritas for
breakfast,&#148; Marin said. As soon as she said the word, she could almost taste the house margaritas at her favorite Mexican
restaurant in San Francisco: the sweet limes, oaky tequila, syrupy Cointreau,
melting ice, and chunky white salt. </p>

<p class="Story">Anwar laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I want to move to
Texas,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No you don&#8217;t,&#148;
Si-Chee said. &#147;Powell hates it there.&#148; Powell was the name of her fianc&#233;. &#147;As soon as we get our green cards we&#8217;re moving to a coast.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You would love San
Francisco,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;<i>Uh!</i>&#148;
†Si-Chee sighed with pleasure. &#147;If I studied redwoods for the rest of my life
I would be totally happy,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="first">A wild and rocky river ran down the middle
of Section A. After a two-hour hike from camp, Will and Marin&#8217;s trail would cross
this river on a rope bridge, head west, loop around black peatland to a
freshwater waterfall, and then come back and cross the river again, seven
kilometers north of the first bridge. Then it would be a fairly simple flat
trek home. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it weird for
you,&#148; Will said, about forty-five minutes out from camp, &#147;Si-Chee moving to the
country you just left?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, not really,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;It might be if she was moving to San Francisco or Chicago, but
not Texas. Texas is like a whole other country.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will agreed silently (as anyone in their demographic would) about the strangeness of Texas.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin asked, &#147;No update on the Indo-Oil situation?&#148; Indo-Oil was the oil
palm firm that had received concessions for 20,000 hectares of jungle in the
O/URC&#8217;s research area; it was the firm that had brought Will and Wan to San Francisco and Pac&#146;s headquarters the previous year. Marin would probably still be at Pac right now if not for the territory dispute with Indo-Oil.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nothing has been
cleared yet still. It&#8217;s very strange,&#148; Will said. &#147;Part of why palm oil is so
lucrative is all the profitable lumber that gets cleared at the outset. Maybe
they&#8217;ve become &#8216;<i>immune to the opportunity</i>&#8217; of easy profit.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had told Will
about Wayan Wijaya and her (presumptuous) observation of Marin&#8217;s supposed
presumption that she was &#147;immune to opportunity,&#148; and it had become an inside
joke for Marin and Will. Although the phrase had been begging for parody since
its inception, Marin always felt a little annoyed every time that Will made a
joke of it. Marin didn&#8217;t feel that she owed anything to Dr. Wijaya, but it was
clear that the story was <i>just</i> a joke to Will&#151;just another ridiculous Pac
ego run wild. Marin didn&#8217;t come here because she resented Pac, its bloat or
its power; she didn&#8217;t come here because of Pac at all. However, laughing at
such jokes in a gesture of friendship made Marin feel as if that would end up
being her story anyhow.</p>

<p class="Story">Over the next hour,
Will and Marin got into a good rhythm. Marin&#8217;s body found an equilibrium, the
first hour&#8217;s sweat dried off, and sometimes under the shade of the canopy she
actually felt cool. They passed trees, rocks, plants, bugs, butterflies,
birds, and one small band of macaques. They talked about the dissertation
thesis defense process; Marin&#8217;s undergraduate thesis presentation; Wan&#8217;s
efforts to recruit a replacement for Si-Chee; Si-Chee&#8217;s upcoming goodbye party;
the upcoming release, which Linda was leading and Marin was tagging along on;
and the cook May&#8217;s background (she was from Kuching and had had a successful
rojak stand in town; after her husband had died of lung cancer two years ago,
Wan had convinced her to come work for the O/URC).</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin
hiked into view of the river. Eight feet below where the jungle floor abruptly
ended, brown water coursed to the right over weeds and rocks and tree roots. It searched for the sea. Eight extension ropes, three on each side and two
above, were tied together at regular intervals to form the bridge, and a vast
amount of rope had been crisscrossed and woven through itself and the bottom
extension ropes. Carved and sanded planks of wood were tied into the bottom.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Story">Marin crossed the
bridge first, with Will one or two feet behind her. She could smell the
ferrous mud of the riverbank and felt the river&#8217;s thin cool steam on her
heels. The bridge planks wobbled beneath her. There was a trick to it: she
stepped onto each plank flatly and then leaned her foot slowly with the plank
as she stepped off. Soon they were on the other side.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what&#8217;s the deal
with this Jo-Jo guy again?&#148; Marin said. &#147;You said there was something you
wanted to tell me about him once we&#8217;d crossed the river.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, yeah. I&#8217;m so
dramatic,&#148; Will said. He told Marin about the missing orangutan. &#147;We&#8217;ve tried
to find her&#151;usually details about amateur deals come to us in some form, if not
the orangutans themselves&#151;but no one&#8217;s seen her.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda knows all
this, though, right?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Will said. &#147;I&#8217;m sure most people have heard rumors by now, too.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That poor
orangutan,&#148; Marin said. &#147;So close to going home, only to be kidnapped again.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You sometimes have
to just hope there&#8217;s a hell, working in this field,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">A bird screamed and
flew out of a tree on their right.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda&#8217;s the only
really religious one at the O/URC, right?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I suppose so,&#148;
Will said, &#147;but when you&#8217;re raised Muslim, it&#8217;s a really difficult thing to
ever turn back from completely. Like, Wan isn&#8217;t religious, but he would never
eat pork. Plus, Malaysians are a pretty conservative bunch in general. Smoking is the one vice everyone can indulge in openly, and most people at the
O/URC don&#8217;t even do that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s strange how
the commitment to science and nature doesn&#8217;t segue to a rationality and
open-mindedness about relationships and sex,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I mean, not just
with LGBT relationships, but even heterosexual dating. Everything seems so
fraught here. People are either engaged, married, or chaste.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think that
flirting happens quite a lot, and it depends on where people are from and where
they went to school how comfortable with the opposite sex they are. And it&#8217;s
really difficult to judge homophobia here because very few Malaysians know an
openly gay person. It&#8217;s like our grandparents&#8217; generation. You don&#8217;t know
what you don&#8217;t know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story"><i>But they could know</i>, Marin thought. <i>They
could know you. </i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin had been less
than pleased when Will had told her that he&#8217;d said nothing after Linda had
implied that he was interested in Marin romantically. Considering how quickly
gossip spread through the O/URC, the story could have at least been given a
degree of ambiguity if Will had said something, anything, to contradict Linda,
but he was too paranoid about their Malaysian coworkers finding out about his
orientation.</p>

<p class="Story">They heard it
first: the rush of water splashing into itself. <i>†</i>It was a
six-meter-high freshwater fall that loped over mossy limestone into a deep
bathing pool surrounded by sunny black rocks. The runoff funneled into a rocky
jungle stream to one side. Shiny green dragonflies flew close to the water. </p>

<p class="Story">Will stripped to
his boxers and hopped to a rock near the deep end. He jumped in, toes pointed
down. Marin took off her shirt and shorts and stepped gingerly to the rock
that Will had jumped off. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How&#8217;s the water?&#148;
she asked, retying her hair into a tight new ponytail.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Amazing,&#148; Will
said, treading water. &#147;Come on, Cali girl. What are you waiting for?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The water roared
behind him, spraying and splashing a row of white surf. Marin jumped in, felt
the shock of cold wet like a blow to the funny bone, and she surfaced laughing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Call me crazy,&#148;
Will said, &#147;but I think that this is actually better than sex.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin felt her
muscles squeeze cleanly through the treads. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Much, much
better,&#148; she said.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Release day was sunny and hot. After a
quick breakfast in canteen, Linda, Si-Chee, Marin, and two O/URC assistants,
Malik and Daru, met at O.Q. Malik arrived driving one of the mini flatbed
trucks that they used at the O/URC to move cargo around. The cargo today was
orangutans, seventeen total: Faiza, Riza, Juno, Sophia, Freida, Fanny, Kathy,
April, Marta, Guinevere, Bea, Farish, Helmut, Khong, Gurney, Simon, and Monty. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda started
taking the to-be-released orangutans out of their cages one-by-one and checking
their vitals, and Marin recorded the numbers on the release chart. Then, Malik
came behind them with syringes of general anesthetic and sedated the checked
orangutans. Daru and Si-Chee carried the sedated orangutans over to
Malik&#8217;s truck and the two other trucks already parked at O.Q. They locked the
orangutans into plastic crates. Malik and Si-Chee lifted the crates together
and placed them on the truck beds, securing them with rope and carabiners.</p>

<p class="Story">Watching Si-Chee
and Daru work, Marin said to Linda, &#147;I guess I should be happy I flew here
coach.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin wasn&#8217;t sure
if Linda truly didn&#8217;t get her jokes when she said &#147;What?&#148; or if that was her
way of disapproving of Marin&#8217;s sense of humor. </p>

<p class="Story">Gia, the baby that
Marin had observed in Level 5 quarantine in med on her first day, was now a
llittle over one years old. She lived in a cage in O.Q. with six other female orangutans of
different ages, including Freida, a seven-year-old being released that day. When Linda opened the door to their cage, Gia scurried out on all fours,
climbing onto Marin and throwing her arms around Marin&#8217;s neck. Gia&#8217;s tiny feet
grabbed at Marin&#8217;s chest for leverage.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin instinctively
placed both hands at Gia&#8217;s back, supporting her, pressing Gia&#8217;s warm, fuzzy
body into her own.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Gia, baby, you&#8217;re
not supposed to be out here,&#148; Marin said, in a tone much closer to sweet-talk
than scolding. She could feel Gia&#8217;s heartbeat against her shoulder, like a
tiny doll drum, thumping quickly after the animal&#8217;s daring Houdini escape.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda let Freida
out and closed the cage behind her. Then, Linda put two fingers in her own
mouth and whistled once authoritatively.</p>

<p class="Story">Gia looked up and
loosened her grip slightly, and Linda picked her up off Marin with both hands
and placed Gia back in the cage, locking it behind her. </p>

<p class="Story">Freida had stayed
put just outside her cage, and Linda put the earbuds of her stethoscope back in
her ears, bent down to Freida, and held the flat white &#147;O&#148; of the diaphragm to
Freida&#8217;s chest. Linda&#8217;s auscultation face resembled exactly the expression on
her face when she listened to Will or Marin speak. </p>

<p class="Story">The release team
finished checking and sedating and packing and loading by nine-thirty a.m., and
Linda, Malik, and Daru drove the trucks out to the dry clearing where
Jo-Jo had the helicopter waiting. Si-Chee and Marin jogged to the med parking
lot, where the jeep that they were driving to the release site was parked. They got into the jeep, and Si-Chee drove to the helicopter clearing.</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo was a
forty-something Chinese man, with a wide dumpling nose and huge pores dotting
his oily face. He was wearing a faded Hawaiian shirt with the three top
buttons unbuttoned, khaki pants, and a pair of bright-white and blue sneakers. He was pushing both thumbs rapidly into the keypad of his cellphone and pacing
behind the butt of the chopper parked in the middle of the grassless clearing
when Marin and Si-Chee pulled up in the jeep.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s mother
Jinny had passed away of cancer when Marin was fifteen, so, when certain traits
that Marin had inherited from her mother flared into the foreground, an amount
of supernatural tinged the air. Surely nurture alone was not enough to explain
Marin&#8217;s occasional Jinny-like ability to improvise her way into and out of the
center of sitcom-like farces with an unreal sense of timing and poetic justice.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda directed
Malik and Daru in loading the orangutan crates into the cabin of the
helicopter. Si-Chee parked and got out to double-check the trunk of the jeep
to make sure that everything that they needed at the release site had been
packed there properly. The sun was close and hot all around them. It was
difficult to look at anything directly. Everything reflected bright light. Only short, scattered thoughts could be thought in such bright light and thick,
close heat. Short, slow, treading thoughts.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin watched as
Jo-Jo locked his cellphone and placed it in his front right pocket. He reached
in his back pocket and pulled out a smooshed box of American brand cigarettes. As he lit his cigarette and took a long drag, Marin opened her car door,
stepped out onto the dark orange dirt of the clearing, and slammed the door
shut behind her.</p>

<p class="Story">She made a beeline
for Jo-Jo. As he turned to look at her with curiosity (they had never met),
Marin saw that he was missing his upper right canine.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, you must be
Jo-Jo,&#148; Marin said in her most nasal Chicago accent, and reached out her hand
and smiled. &#147;I&#8217;m Marin Choo, the new communications director? I&#8217;m going to tag along on the release today?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo grinned and
shook her hand. &#147;Hello,&#148; he said. &#147;Where do you come from?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;America, I guess?&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;American?&#148; Jo-Jo
said. The idea seemed difficult for him to accept. &#147;Your parents?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Chinese,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You don&#8217;t speak
Chinese?&#148; Jo-Jo said. He repeated the question in Amoy: <i>&#147;Do you understand
how to speak Chinese?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin waved the incomprehensible
gibberish away. &#147;Can I, like, borrow your cellphone?&#148; she said. &#147;I forgot to
put on sunblock this morning. I need to call Dr. St. James to ask him to bring
some here? Just two seconds with your phone is all I need.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You need my
phone?&#148; Jo-Jo said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll totally burn
in this sun without sunblock,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I feel so stupid that I forgot to
put some on this morning, but you know when you get in that mindset of
following other people you sort of stop thinking at all?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo reached in his
pocket, brought out his cellphone, and handed it to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">She pushed the
first digit of Will&#8217;s phone number, but the cellphone flashed a LOCKED message
in Chinese.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I think it&#8217;s
locked?&#148; Marin said, and held out the phone to him. &#147;Can you open?&#148; She
tapped on the blank screen and mimed twisting a key in a lock.</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo took his
phone back, pressed the star and pound keys simultaneously, and the screen lit
up with the date and time. He handed her back the phone with a tiny wave of
his hand. &#147;Open now, miss,&#148; he said and smiled.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin stepped away
from Jo-Jo into the sun&#8217;s glare. He only seemed comfortable eyeing her for a
split-second every minute or so out of the corner of his eye. Marin quickly
opened the menu, scrolled down and clicked to the text inbox, and opened it. She opened five texts before she got to one in Bahasa that she understood more than two words of. <i>&#147;Orangutan,&#148;</i> being a word of Bahasa Malaysia origin, was
clear enough, as was <i>&#147;RM5000.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo seemed to
realize that some kind of subterfuge was happening as soon as Marin saw what
she saw. He cursed in Amoy and threw his cigarette to the side. He walked
over angrily, and Marin ran away from him around the helicopter
counter-clockwise. Her sandals slipped on the uneven dirt, but she knew that
she wouldn&#8217;t fall.</p>

<p class="Story">For some reason,
she ran around the helicopter twice, as if in the extra loop she would lose
Jo-Jo. He did break into a sloppy jog following her around the second time and
was soon out of breath. Marin ran over to Linda.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda, I&#8217;ve got
Jo-Jo&#8217;s cellphone. Does this say what I think it says?&#148; Marin said, thrusting
the phone and the text on its screen into Linda&#8217;s sightline.</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo stopped
briefly in the shadow of the helicopter, then started shouting in Amoy: <i>&#147;What
are you doing? That&#8217;s my phone! Give it back to me!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Linda pulled the
phone from Marin&#8217;s hand and read the text aloud in Bahasa, and Malik and Daru
both stopped what they were doing. </p>

<p class="Story">Everyone started
talking all at once.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Those are my
private messages! I get offers from people, but I&#8217;ve never done anything
wrong!&#148;</i>
Jo-Jo shouted in Chinese.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Five thousand
ringgit!&#148; Malik said. &#147;Bloody fucking stupid idiot.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What kind of man
are you?&#148; Daru said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s going on?&#148;
Si-Chee said, running over.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda put two
fingers in her mouth and whistled the whistle that had halted Gia&#8217;s escape.</p>

<p class="Story">Everybody stopped
and quieted.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jo-Jo, where is
Preity?&#148; Linda said, holding his phone straight above her head with her arm
fully extended. &#147;Tell me now, or, I swear, Forestry officials will be sent to
your apartment every single day for the rest of your life.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jo-Jo muttered an
address in Kuching. &#147;That&#8217;s where you can send your dogs,&#148; he said, spitting
once to the side. He took a key out of his pocket and threw it on the ground. Linda threw him his phone, and he caught it with two hands. He marched away,
in the direction of the highway. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda immediately
called Wan and told him an abbreviated version of what had happened and the
address that Jo-Jo had given.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What about
release?&#148; Malik asked Linda when she had gotten off the phone. &#147;Even if the
new pilot leave from Kuching now we don&#8217;t have time.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Si-Chee walked over
to the helicopter, walked around it once clockwise, studied it as if it were an
ancient cypress of note, and then came back. &#147;I can fly this one,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; Linda said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I got my pilot
license,&#148; Si-Chee said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You have a license
to fly a helicopter?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Si-Chee shrugged. &#147;I only passed all the requirements last week. It&#8217;s useful for traveling to
see plants I want to see sometimes.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">There were two full
seconds of silence and disbelief&#151;it just didn&#8217;t seem real. Then, Linda burst
out laughing, a rolling, moss-gathering stone of a laugh. &#147;Our pilot is a
kidnapper!&#148; she cried out, in between laughs, &#147;but our botanist is a pilot!&#148; She was bent over and holding her straining belly now; it was just too much. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda&#146;s laughter spread through the clearing like a new virus in a population with no immunity. They didn&#8217;t know what was funnier: the relief that Preity&#8217;s
kidnapper had been identified and ousted, the shock that it had been someone
that they had trusted, the amazing speed with which it all had happened, the
secret helicopter pilot in their midst, or their aloof head vet being reduced
to uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p class="Story">A few moments
later, the release was back in full swing. The key was picked up from where
Jo-Jo had tossed it on the ground and dusted off. Si-Chee got into the pilot&#8217;s
seat and looked confident checking her gauges and gears. Malik, Daru, and
Marin piled into the jeep. Linda discussed the location of the release site
with Malik and then climbed into the passenger&#8217;s seat of the helicopter. After
a few seconds she got out again and shouted something at the jeep. Marin
realized that it was her name. Linda scooped her hands into her chest&#151;she
wanted Marin to come in the chopper with them.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin hopped out of
the jeep and jogged over to Linda.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How much do you
weigh? Fifty kilos?&#148; Linda asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fifty-two,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, you should
come with us then. Us Chinese girls should stick together,&#148; Linda said. She
put her arm on Marin&#8217;s back and gently pushed her once toward the chopper.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
hooked her foot onto the small metal step and hoisted herself up into the cabin
of the helicopter. She turned and sat on a vinyl-covered seat, buckling the
seat belt around her waist. The thick mammal musk of the orangutans filled the
cabin. Si-Chee pressed something and the cabin doors, raised on both sides
like gull wings, lowered and closed around Marin and the sleeping, crated
animals. Si-Chee gassed up, and the helicopter&#8217;s metal rotor began to spin
above them. Long, powerful torque waves shook the vehicle, and they
rose. The ground receded, Marin saw a lemur scurrying through the dark
branches of the nearby canopy, and then they were flying over the jungle, its
mysteries reduced to a dense carpet of green treetops passing below them. Far,
far off in the distance, Marin could see a blue one half-shade darker than the
sky: the sea.</p>

<p class="first">They landed the helicopter in a clearing in
the northern end of the area of uninhabited (by wild orangutans) jungle reserve
that was to be the new home of Faiza, Riza, Juno, Sophia, Freida, Fanny, Kathy, April,
Marta, Guinevere, Bea, Farish, Helmut, Khong, Gurney, Simon, and Monty. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda, Si-Chee, and
Marin unloaded the crates from the helicopter, unlocked and opened them, and
pulled the unconscious orangutans out onto the grass. Half an hour into this
process, Malik and Daru came hiking swarthily into the clearing&#151;they&#8217;d
had to leave the jeep seven hundred meters back. The men helped them unload
the crates and pack the emptied crates back into the helicopter. At around two
o&#8217;clock, the orangutans started to wake up. Linda checked their vitals as the
others helped the apes walk off the sedation and communicated to them through
gestures and the exaggerated inflections of their voices that they were free.</p>

<p class="Story">The sub-adult
Helmut was the first to go. He scampered on all fours to a nearby tree and
quickly climbed its trunk. He paused on a thick branch, squatted, holding
himself up with one hand on a branch above him, and looked back at the crowd,
the strange business, in the clearing. He grabbed another branch, farther
away, and swung on it into the canopy. His swings picked up speed slowly, and
he was gone. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin tried to avoid
the sentimental anthropomorphizing so rampant in modern primatology, but the
truth was that she was proud to work with the most independent-minded of the
great apes. Orangutans weren&#8217;t joiners like gorillas, relentless slaves to
society like chimps, or hippie bonobos with no sense of boundaries. In the
jungle, they went for weeks on end on their own&#151;passing other orangutans
through the canopy with nothing more than an exchange of ambivalent glances.</p>

<p class="Story">Most of the O/URC&#8217;s
seventeen ex-caps left the release site with a fairly steep absence of regard
for both their human rehabilitators and their fellow ex-captives. They
scattered one-by-one in different directions like Helmut: efficiently and
without emotion. </p>

<p class="Story">One of the females,
Bea, became agitated. She ran to the helicopter and jumped into the empty
pilot seat. She screamed and clawed at the leather of the seat back. Then,
calm suddenly, she turned around and sat properly in the seat, with her feet
dangling over the edge. She reached behind herself, pulled the seat belt
around and over her waist, and buckled it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Shit,&#148; Malik said.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda went to her
bag and pulled out a small black case. She opened it and removed a syringe.</p>

<p class="Story">One thing
orangutans and humans have in common: <i>we are our own worst enemies.</i></p>

<p class="Story">Or at least this is
what Marin thought before she realized that she was rehearsing her description
of the release for her inevitable conversation with Will about it that night at
canteen. This realization worried her. Will wasn&#8217;t her boyfriend. Marin hadn&#8217;t
dated since she&#8217;d broken up with Dave the philosophy TA a few days before
spring break of her senior year of college, one year ago now. If Marin wasn&#8217;t
careful, she would end up mistaking her relationship with Will for something
that it could never be.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Two weeks later, a sweet, fat smell filled
the area surrounding canteen as the O/URC&#8217;s cook May made steamed buns
filled with yellow lotus seed paste and green pandan-flavored sugar cookies cut
into the shape of leaves for Si-Chee&#8217;s goodbye party. </p>

<p class="Story">The mood all over
camp had been extremely festive all day as Preity had finally been found, in a building half-a-mile down from the address that Jo-Jo had given them. That morning
Preity had been rescued from captivity for the second time. She&#8217;d been starved,
muffled, and chained to a pole in an empty rowhouse, but she was recuperating
now in med and Linda said that she&#8217;d be fine.</p>

<p class="Story">A little before
three in the afternoon, Will and Marin walked from office to the party in
canteen together. It was a sunny day after three days of rain, and small birds
were flying overhead in the trees, tweeting pleasantly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I will never
forget seeing the helicopter land after release,&#148; Will said, &#147;and seeing you,
Linda, and Si-Chee come out of there cool as cucumbers.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, we&#8217;re pretty
badass,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">There was a good
crowd at canteen already. Si-Chee&#8217;s fianc&#233; Powell had flown in to help
her pack and ship her stuff. He was feeding Si-Chee a snow-white bun. She
took a bite, nodded as she chewed and swallowed, and said something to him
close to his ear. Wan and Dilip were talking and making several kettles of tea
at a table in the corner. Linda was talking to a group of Iban and Bidayuh
assistants about Preity: the condition she&#8217;d been found in, what Linda had found
during her medical exam, and Preity&#8217;s prospects for a full and rapid recovery. May and her nieces had changed from their baking clothes into dresses and were
sitting at one of the tables having tea and cookies.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had given
only five days&#8217; notice when she&#8217;d left Pac, but if her former coworkers had
been shocked or upset by her sudden exit, they&#8217;d played their cards very close
to their chests. Ray Marcos had been particularly uninsulted.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re going to
work at that monkey farm, aren&#8217;t you?&#148; he&#8217;d said, looking very excited to very
soon be proven, once again, right about everyone and everything.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Orangutan
rehabilitation center,&#148; Marin had said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I knew it! I knew
as soon as I met those ape dudes that you were going to run off with them,&#148;
Ray had said. &#147;Marin, take some advice from me, okay? Are you listening?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Always, Ray,&#148;
Marin had said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Stay away from the
true believers. There&#8217;s going to be opportunists and schemers there, but it&#8217;s
the true believers you have to watch out for. They&#8217;re the ones who will be
threatened by someone like you. They&#8217;ll try to warp you and disorient you, and
not with any end goal in mind. They&#8217;re crazy people who are threatened by
you&#151;a very volatile combination.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">At the time, Marin
had thought that Ray had described himself perfectly: he was crazy (obviously)
and threatened, not by Marin herself, but by the thought that she could walk
away from him and Pac intact. However, she&#8217;d also believed him a little.</p>

<p class="Story">Looking around
canteen at her hardworking and dedicated coworkers now, Marin thought (with
some self-congratulating) that Ray had been wrong for once. Her O/URC
coworkers were not only neither crazy nor opportunistic, they were the most
normal, uncomplicated bunch of people that she had ever met.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you &#8216;immune to
the opportunity&#8217; of a steamed bun?&#148; Will asked Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">He smiled. Such a
handsome smile; such a handsome man. Surely some boy would find him, fall in
love with him, and move to the jungle for him.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin was too
paranoid. She still had too much Ray Marcos in her head. She&#8217;d been reading
too much into Will&#8217;s fondness for the &#147;immune to opportunity&#148; joke. Of course
Will found it funny&#151;not because he needed to feel superior to Pac, but because
Marin&#8217;s exchange with Dr. Wijaya had been absurd.</p>

<p class="Story">Still, Marin
insisted that she get her food herself.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Walter</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">W</span>alter liked San Francisco. He found it
very amusing, all of the middle-aged hippies still pining away for the sixties
even though their so-called revolution was now just another capitalistic
purchase behind scratched glass in the head shops on Haight Street. They had
run out of identity groups to be upset on behalf of, and so now they were upset
about drugs. The Puff the Magic Dragon and LSD crowd was now upset about all of
the selling and giving away of drugs.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter had flown
out to San Francisco for the launch of Fenniskrante&#8217;s new neuropathic pain
medication Dipentra. He&#8217;d come half a day early in order to squeeze in a
dinner with his daughter and her new (Jewish) boyfriend. </p>

<p class="last">The
boyfriend had worked at a hedge fund in New York, which Walter found very
ironic, considering his daughter&#8217;s historical disapproval of self-enrichment
for self-enrichment&#8217;s sake. Walter would keep quiet, though. He wanted an
uneventful dinner tonight because he had an important mission to execute during
the weekend&#8217;s launch. There was no room for distractions. </p>

<p class="first">Marin had made a reservation at a nice
restaurant that both Choos liked that served Chinese banquet-style food in a
clean, bright, modern setting. Walter was the first to arrive, so, after being
seated on the second floor at a table covered with a white tablecloth and three
sets of white dinner china, he made small talk with the waiter in
Cantonese&#151;most San Francisco Chinese spoke Cantonese, like Walter&#151;and ordered a
beer. If it had just been him and Marin tonight, Walter would have also
ordered dinner, but who knew what the boyfriend ate or didn&#8217;t eat.</p>

<p class="Story">His daughter came
up the stairs first, her hair grown long and tied into a loose knot at the back
of her neck. She was casual and cool in a red V-neck shirt and jeans. Despite their
differences, Marin had grown into a confident, capable young woman in the mold
of her mother, and Walter was quite proud of her. However, Walter had not
forgotten the <i>&#147;I&#8217;m moving to Borneo in nine days&#148;</i> phone call that he
had received two years ago.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s new
boyfriend had thick dark brown hair and a haughty face. Walter gave himself
permission to be a little mean tonight. Just enough to have some fun.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin hugged Walter
hello and introduced &#147;Charlie.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie awkwardly
pulled Marin&#8217;s chair out for her in a triplet of rough jags, and then stuck his
hand out to Walter. Walter shook it, and Charlie said, &#147;Pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Choo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter hated him
already. He asked Charlie if he liked Chinese food.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I grew up on
kungpao chicken and chow mein,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Dad, he eats
everything,&#148;</i>
Marin said in Cantonese. <i>&#147;Let&#8217;s start with seafood soup, then
salt-and-pepper porkchops, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, fermented black
bean clams, honey walnut prawns, and fried rice.&#148; </i>She finished in English:
&#147;that&#8217;s plenty of food.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">She flagged down a
waiter, and Walter ordered the food without edit. Marin and Charlie ordered
beers, the same brand as Walter&#8217;s.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, Dr. Choo, I
hear you&#8217;re a longtime employee of good old FNSK,&#148; Charlie said. FNSK was
Fenniskrante&#8217;s NYSE abbreviation. &#147;When I worked in financial analysis, we
used to move one thousand shares of FNSK around the office for fun because it
never budged from three points of forty. If it actually made more than $3,000,
then the person who had the FNSK that day would have to buy everyone else shots
at happy hour.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, FNSK has
turned into the Old Reliable of the New York Stock Exchange the past few
years,&#148; Walter said. &#147;I think the company&#8217;s interested in shaking things up,
but they don&#8217;t know how. Marin says that you&#8217;re a writer now?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, I&#8217;ve always
had these twin paths, ever since grade school: left-brain and right-brain, math
and English, mathletes and newspaper. After going hardcore left-brain for five
years in New York&#133; I don&#8217;t know. I really missed writing and reporting. Processing information through arguments and jokes and exaggerations and
metaphors, not just numbers. I am writing about statistics and economics, though,
so I didn&#8217;t give that part of my life up.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The game was: <i>how
much money did Charlie leave New York with?</i> Charlie had blasted them right
into the middle of it. Of course he had; it was probably a lot of money. Nothing to be ashamed of at a dinner with your girlfriend&#8217;s father. That
didn&#8217;t mean that Charlie was going to give the number up quickly, nor would
Walter have wanted him to.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Charlie has
actually already been approached by other blogs to come write for them,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;But he has a pretty strong vision of what he wants to do with his own
site first, so.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you really
think you&#8217;ll be able to make money off of your own website?&#148; Walter asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think the magic
number for getting any real advertising money is ten thousand hits a day,&#148; Charlie
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you must be
pretty close to that if other people have been offering you jobs,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I clear ten
thousand about twice a month, if there&#8217;s a new post that people email their
friends about,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;And I&#8217;m on the right people&#8217;s radar.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It still must seem
like small change compared to the days of $40,000 hot potato,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin yawned. </p>

<p class="Story">Charlie laughed. &#147;Actually,&#148; he said, &#147;money seems to go a lot farther these days than it did
when I was in New York. I would go out for dinner and a few drinks on Saturday
night and blow $400. Sometimes the food wasn&#8217;t even that good. You just pay
$20 more for your Caesar salad to sit fifty feet from a supermodel. And, I
mean, I was in a relationship the whole time I was in New York, so my social
life was pretty tame compared to my single friends in finance.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s like New York
dollars are an entirely different currency now,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Four to one
exchange rate.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wage rates and
cost of living have always had local correlation,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;That&#8217;s
nothing new.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s and
Charlie&#8217;s beers arrived along with the soup, which was ladled by the waiter
from one big bowl into three small bowls at their table. Milk-white shreds of
egg floated in the pale yellow broth, along with nickel-sized shrimps and
strings of crab meat.</p>

<p class="Story">They made small
talk about Walter&#8217;s flight and hotel while Walter strategized. He knew that
Charlie lived in an apartment in a building owned by his mother, so questioning
how he could afford San Francisco rents was out of the question.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m so tired,&#148;
Marin said, yawning again.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s what
staying up until two in the morning every night will do,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin gave Charlie
a look.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re having
trouble sleeping?&#148; Walter asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, I think I
need to get a new bed,&#148; Marin said. &#147;My mattress is very&#133; fallen in the
middle.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">It wasn&#8217;t a
lie&#151;Walter had seen her bed and could tell just from looking at it that it
didn&#8217;t provide much in the way of back support, but his daughter was definitely
hiding something. He had the feeling that he didn&#8217;t want to know what, that it
was one of those things that he just wouldn&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p class="Story">They moved from a
discussion of mattresses to a discussion of sleeping pills (Charlie used them
for international flights, but didn&#8217;t need them to sleep at home), and Walter
had no choice but to dive back into the game.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think someone
from your office had to buy shots when we posted quarter one results last year
with first-year sales of Oblion at three-hundred mill,&#148; Walter said. &#147;Even the
HMOs want Oblion, I don&#8217;t know why. It must be costing them a fortune.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Pretty much any
doctor can prescribe them, right?&#148; Charlie said. &#147;I get mine from my
internist.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We actively market
to psych, neuro, and gyn (a high percentage of insomniacs are women, I guess),
but everyone knows the big Z drugs now,&#148; Walter said. &#147;You&#8217;re doing COBRA?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I didn&#8217;t really
like our plan in New York, plus I was changing cities, so I just bought on the
market,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;It&#8217;s a little bit more per month than the COBRA would
have been, but I&#8217;m still in a relatively cheap age bracket.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">He paused, and
their food came. Two waiters put twelve pounds of food on the table in a
matter of seconds: crispy fried pork chops, tight fat C&#8217;s of butterflied prawns
glistening in white mayonnaise, green gailan stalks drizzled with fudgy oyster
sauce, Cantonese fried rice, and clams steamed open and wok-fried with fermented
black beans and chili. </p>

<p class="Story">And then, as
instantaneously as their food had been brought to the table, Charlie said
it: &#147;I have about $50,000 cash saved plus about $200,000 in the market, so I
should be good for awhile.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">It was like
accidentally checkmating one&#146;s opponent during a game of chess&#151;a joyless, awkward victory. </p>

<p class="last"><i>Had
the boy wanted to concentrate on his food?</i> Well, if that had been the case,
then Walter hadn&#8217;t won at all. Walter hadn&#8217;t known that they&#8217;d been racing
their dinner. He hadn&#8217;t understood the rules of the game.</p>

<p class="first">It was common knowledge among
Fenniskrante&#8217;s regional sales managers that Eric Mulrhony&#8217;s one hobby was real
estate: he bought, renovated, and resold (at a profit) condos and townhomes all
over the Chicago metropolitan area. He had a million stories about his real
estate dealings and loved to give advice about the subject. Walter&#8217;s plan was
to first start spreading the rumor that he (Walter) was thinking of helping his
daughter buy a place in San Francisco and needed advice on choosing a real
estate broker. Inevitably, most people would tell him to ask Mulrhony. </p>

<p class="Story">When Walter finally
ran into Mulrhony that weekend, Walter would approach him for his advice on
choosing between two real estate brokers. The first, Ethan, was extremely
thorough, knowledgeable, and reliable. He returned Walter&#8217;s phone calls and
emails punctually and followed through on his promises to obtain information on
specific properties. The second, Chuck, was also pretty good, but not as
reliable and quick to respond as Ethan. He did have a flair and confidence
about him that the more staid Ethan lacked. He made the shopping process more
fun and less stressful, and he was very optimistic, always saying that he was
sure that Walter and Marin were going to &#147;fall in love&#148; with a great place and
that Marin was &#147;meant&#148; to be a homeowner.</p>

<p class="Story">All of this was an
elaborate fiction of course, made up to make Eric Mulrhony admit the undeniable
truth: that effort (Ethan) was preferable to charm (Chuck). Walter wouldn&#8217;t
push it farther than the fictional real estate scenario. Hearing Mulrhony
vocalize his own hypocrisy would be enough for Walter.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter woke up at
six a.m. in a dark hotel room on the first morning of the Dipentra launch. He
opened his curtains, booted up his laptop, and opened the Dipentra detail. As
a regional sales manager, he&#8217;d received an electronic copy of it via email the
night before. As he read it&#151;his second pass now&#151;he could feel its
explanations, statistics, and clean, unilateral flow of logic become familiar. It would be second nature after two more passes.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter showered and
dressed quickly. He tore open the brown coffee foil and put the round pillow
of coffee in the top of the small coffeemaker. He filled the pot with water in
the bathroom sink and poured it into the back of the coffee pot. He slid the
pot back into its slot and pressed the switch on the machine&#8217;s side, made it
glow red. Loud brew noises were followed by a spitting trickle and the
familiar smell of bitter roast. </p>

<p class="Story">There was a knock
on the door. Walter hadn&#8217;t been to a launch in a year and a half, but this was
unprecedented. If people wanted to meet each other, for dinner or to walk over
to the launch events together, they called and met in the hotel lobby. Walter
had always assumed that this convention was to make it more difficult for
people to bother higher-ups, but now that he thought about it, it probably had
something to do with the occasional illicit fraternizing between men and women
that happened amidst the chaos of a launch.</p>

<p class="Story">He walked quietly
to the door and squinted one eye closed to look through the peephole. It was
Peter Jensen, the Michigan regional sales manager. Walter opened the door.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Walter, you have
to call all your reps,&#148; Peter said. &#147;Our delegation is heading out the back
entrance at seven-thirty. Some &#145;No on Prop 66A&#146; protestors already have the whole street
blocked off in front of Moscone.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you kidding
me?&#148; Walter said. &#147;They&#8217;re protesting the launch of a new treatment for
chronic neuropathic pain? What kind of sense does that make?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s San
Francisco,&#148; Peter said. &#147;If it isn&#8217;t made out of tofu, they protest it. Gotta
go tell the rest of the managers. Just be downstairs at the exit by the big
cube sculpture in half an hour with your reps.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter called his
reps and told them what Peter had said, still unconvinced that it had been
information that had warranted a protocol-breaking knock on the door. A half
an hour later, Walter was on his way out when he saw that the red light of the
coffeemaker was still on, the glass pot on its black plate half-full of coffee:
he&#8217;d forgotten it in the excitement. He switched it off and poured a cup&#151;it
was warm, not hot. Walter drank it in one three-swallow chug without tasting
it. He poured another cup and drank it the same way. </p>

<p class="Story">The
five-hundred-person Midwest delegation was gathered in many small huddles
downstairs, spilling through the long hallway over into the main lobby of the
hotel. The hotel was only a few blocks away from the Moscone Center, the
launch site, where the protestors had stationed their
(apparently unemployed, as it was Friday) troops. Walter could hear them from
inside the hotel. Someone called into a megaphone, and the rest of the crowd
cheered or chanted in response. Walter thought he heard the phrases <i>&#147;Hippocratic
oath&#148;</i> and <i>&#147;profit-driven diagnoses.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">At
seven-thirty-five, two security guys in black jackets carrying black
walkie-talkies came up to and opened the hotel doors and started shooing
Fenniskrante people out onto the sidewalk. Another security guy led them in a
single-file line out to Third Street and around the corner. Across the street,
metal police barricades blocked off the strip of road between the Moscone
Center and the park across the street from it, behind which a circus of people
carrying &#147;YES on Prop 66A&#148; signs and a surprising number of children, dogs, and
bicycles were crammed. </p>

<p class="Story">A Caucasian man
Walter&#8217;s age had shoulder-length hair, the megaphone, and lots to say:
&#147;FENNISKRANTE ALONE SPENT $900 MILLION ON SALES AND MARKETING LAST YEAR. $900
MILLION OF FREEBIES, FANCY DINNERS, GOLF VACATIONS&#151;WHY? OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF
THEIR HEARTS?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everything about
the man with the megaphone gave Walter the creeps.</p>

<p class="Story">A fourth security
guy nodded at the Fenniskrante reps as they filed through an open fire door into
the convention center. They walked through an empty maintenance hallway
through double doors into a small side gallery with empty glass poster cases on
the walls. Some registration tables had been set up there. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter checked in
at the regional manager table and got his launch ID badge and a folder. The
baby blue shoelace string that the ID badge was looped onto had <i>&#147;Dipentra&#148;</i>
written on it many times in a row. The baby blue folder was also branded with
the Dipentra logo and had a branded baby blue detail book and detail card
inside. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I didn&#8217;t get my
sample bag at the hotel. Are they inside?&#148; Walter asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No sample bags
this year,&#148; the registration girl said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure?
Maybe the production staff messed up. At the Perpetua launch our bags were one
day late because of a typo at the printers,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nope,&#148; Stu Carroll
said, coming up behind Walter and patting him on the back. &#147;Fenniskrante&#8217;s
scaling down on the freebies this year, Walter. No free Dipentra post-its for
you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ever since Stu had
been revealed as the top-selling rep in the country, he&#8217;d dropped any semblance
of respect for Walter&#8217;s seniority and authority over him and pretty much did as
he pleased. His voice, when speaking to Walter, reeked of the idiotic
condescension of the young.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess I&#8217;ll
live,&#148; Walter said. </p>

<p class="Story">Stu laughed. &#147;Yeah, I don&#8217;t mind the post-its either, but if they cut off my Perpetua
supply, my girlfriend&#8217;s gonna be <i>pee oh&#8217;d</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They walked into
the main event space together. Hip hop music was blasting on the audio system,
drowning out both the megaphone man outside and the fifteen-hundred
Fenniskrante employees inside. The fifteen-minute &#147;film special&#148; about
Dipentra that had been shot and cut for an experimental web broadcast played on
huge flatscreen TVs all over the 260,000-square-foot space. The
sixty-something Oscar winner that some lucky marketing schmuck had convinced to
come on board as Dipentra&#8217;s spokeswoman oozed wisdom, grace, strength, and
health as she fake-gardened, played with her fake grandkids, and talked about
her fibromyalgia and the miracle whose name was Dipentra. Stationed in booths
along the center of the floor were Fenniskrante employees in white lab
coats&#151;sales engineers not R&amp;D&#151;ready to answer sales team members&#8217; questions
about the science behind the product. In booths along the perimeter,
Fenniskrante sales trainers in baby blue Dipentra polo shirts tucked into
belted khakis ran through the Dipentra detail and timed and judged reps as they
delivered the new detail in competition with each other. There were a few
general purpose Fenniskrante booths sprinkled throughout the room, filled with
photos of the company&#8217;s downtown Chicago headquarters and Philadelphia and
Lugano labs, and booster-y facts about the company&#8217;s robust financial
performance and numerous innovation milestones and awards, just to remind
everyone of whose side they were on. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Looks like my N.C.
crew is here,&#148; Stu said, waving to a group of young reps talking outside a
training booth. &#147;Catch you later, Walter.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Stu walked off and
disappeared into the crowd. Walter hadn&#8217;t wanted to discuss his fake real
estate broker dilemma with Fenniskrante&#8217;s golden boy anyway.</p>

<p class="Story">Launches always
felt chaotic, but this year the agitators outside had infected the delicate
balance of clubhouse merriment and sci-fi seriousness inside the Moscone Center
with the cooties of self-consciousness. Like the malfeasant body of an
immune-suppressed patient, the launch crowd had lost its ability to process
isolated forays into hysteria without incident. At launches past, Walter had
witnessed certain personality types run haywire in response to all the
stimulation, but because so little at a launch besides the detail mantras
stuck&#151;you met hundreds of people and promptly forgot their names&#151;no permanent
damage, to careers or feelings, had ever been done. This year, each germ of a
bad idea or subversive emotion had the potential to spread through the crowd
and replicate exponentially.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter felt strongly
that eliminating the sample bags had been a mistake: unnecessary and terrible
for company morale. Since when did a bunch of do-nothing outsiders dictate policy
for the launch of a new Fenniskrante drug? Perhaps he could work his
disapproval with this decision into his conversation with Eric Mulrhony.</p>

<p class="Story">With that, Walter
launched full-speed into his plan. He stopped a pair of Indiana sales reps
that he&#8217;d met before, made small talk with them, and told them about his San
Francisco broker problem. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know
anything about real estate, but I&#8217;d go on your gut on that one,&#148; the rep named
Devin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe you can get
Mulrhony to sell you one of his places,&#148; the rep named Christoph said. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter laughed. &#147;Probably not a good idea to enter into a business relationship with your boss&#146;s boss,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;True, true,&#148;
Christoph said. &#147;Oh, fuck, what if the source is Mulrhony?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No fucking way,&#148;
Devin said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mulrhony&#146;s a marketing guy,&#148; Christoph said. &#147;He&#146;s never liked sales. He wants his entire budget to go to TV and web because that&#146;s what he understands.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If he wanted to do
that, he&#8217;d just do it,&#148; Devin said. &#147;Senior vice prez of sales and marketing
doesn&#8217;t have to go anonymously tipping off bloggers about inside shit.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s this?&#148;
Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;All the liberal
blogs are &#8216;abuzz&#8217; with the news that certain pharmaceutical companies have been
calling their precious Nazi drug marketing bills &#8216;D.A.R.E. bills,&#8217; and that is
somehow arrogant and disrespectful to American voters,&#148; Devin said. &#147;The
original blogger cited an &#8216;anonymous Chicago source,&#8217; so all of the other
companies think that Fenniskrante screwed them over in exchange for media
silence on the Filatin debacle.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Filatin was a
prescription cystic fibrosis inhalant that had had to be recalled in January
because it had caused rectal bleeding in a few patients. Nobody had died, and
Fenniskrante had paid a handsome settlement to each of the injured parties, but
it was still a sensitive subject for the brand, and the industry in general, in
these trying times.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are people really
worried about this&#151;this blogger thing?&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">Devin and Christoph
looked at each other nervously.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think people are
worried about their jobs,&#148; Christoph said. &#147;There have been rumors. Like,
from people who don&#8217;t gossip.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s
ridiculous,&#148; Walter said. &#147;I haven&#8217;t heard a thing, and I&#8217;m in Chicago.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because you&#8217;re a
top thirteen manager with the number one rep!&#148; Devin said. &#147;Of course you
haven&#8217;t heard anything.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You guys have
nothing to worry about,&#148; Walter said. &#147;None of these propositions are going to
pass, and even if by some miracle one does, we&#8217;ll find a way around it. We
always do. I&#8217;ve been around a long time. Trust me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Devin and Christoph
nodded and told Walter that he was right. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s reassurances of the younger reps succeeded in quashing his own nascent unease as well. Unfortunately, the D.A.R.E. bills meme had already metastasized through
the entire Dipentra launch organism. Each manager, rep, researcher, and suit
that Walter spoke to was talking about the &#147;anonymous Chicago source,&#148; the liberal
bloggers, and the potential fallout for the drug industry in terms of both
intercorporate relations and voter sentiment. Conspiracy theories, like the
theory about Mulrhony being the source and the theory about a backroom tradeoff
for Filatin, abounded. However, no one else mentioned concern for their own
jobs, the way Devin and Christoph had. </p>

<p class="Story">At some point
during that morning, someone figured out how to patch CNN into one of the TVs. The bastards were actually covering this like it was a real news story! A
large crowd gathered around the hacked TV.</p>

<p class="Story">The female talking
head chirped: <i>&#147;Backers of California, West Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota,
and Iowa propositions to regulate pharmaceutical marketers&#8217; access to
physicians and their prescription-writing data are outraged today at news that
pharmaceutical corporations like Fenniskrante and Pfizer have been referring to
the five state propositions as &#8216;D.A.R.E. bills.&#8217; A collective statement from proponents of the propositions was issued today and begins: &#8216;Names are important. This is further evidence that the pharmaceutical industry sees medications as
products to be marketed and sold like any consumer good and not as part of
complex health care treatment regimes to be determined by doctors based upon
the individual needs of their patients.&#8217;&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">The CNN anchor left it at that.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter walked away
from the TV, annoyed. His stomach cramped suddenly, an arid, twisting pain
deep inside his abdomen. Its origin was certainly either repressed annoyance
at all the stupidity surrounding him or the hotel coffee that he&#8217;d chugged down
responsibly that morning. </p>

<p class="Story">No matter. Walter
would just swallow the pain. Swallowing pain had been a talent of Walter&#8217;s
ever since he was young, taught to him by a distant great uncle. The uncle had probably been
full of horse manure, but Walter had been able to work the trick
consistently over many years. He couldn&#8217;t do it with all pains&#151;just migraines,
stomach cramps, and muscle soreness. Pain was a neurological function, so of
course the mind could shut it off at will, if a person&#8217;s will and skills of
self-awareness were great enough. Walter concentrated and counted backwards
from thirty. When he got to <i>three, two, one</i>, the pain was gone, and
Walter walked right into Eric Mulrhony&#8217;s shoulder. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whoa, Walter, are
you okay?&#148; Eric asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Eric had been
talking to a California regional manager, Tabitha, whose territory had been
ranked number nine in the country that year.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m
fine,&#148; Walter said. &#147;Swallowed it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Swallowed it?&#148;
Eric said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, I decided to
swallow my annoyance at all this D.A.R.E. bills nonsense,&#148; Walter improvised. &#147;It&#8217;s just a nickname.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m going to check
on my new rep,&#148; Tabitha said. &#147;She&#8217;s training with Art. I&#8217;ll see you tonight,
Eric.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course,
Tabitha,&#148; Eric said. &#147;Great to see you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Tabitha left.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sorry,&#148; Eric
said. &#147;What were you saying, Walter?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Art Quaade&#8217;s
here?&#148; Walter said. &#147;I didn&#8217;t see him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, no. Art
Quaade retired in April, didn&#8217;t you hear?&#148; Eric said. &#147;This is one of our new
guys. Art Joliet. He&#8217;s pretty good. He&#8217;s over in the front over there.&#148; Eric pointed to a booth in the middle row, at the front of the room. &#147;You
should meet him. He&#8217;s trying to find a place in Naperville. He and his wife
have a three-year-old.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s stomach
cramped sharply. &#147;A three-year-old, huh!&#148; Walter shouted. He tried to swallow
the pain again. <i>Thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-eight.</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure
you&#8217;re okay?&#148; Eric said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My daughter&#8217;s
buying a place here,&#148; Walter hurried through the words. &#147;An apott-mint?&#148; The
pain was excruciating, like someone had grabbed the bottom of his stomach and
was squeezing it and pulling it down.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh boy, you better
sit down,&#148; Eric said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe I need a
&#8216;sophisticated pharmacological GABA analogue,&#8217;&#148; Walter said, quoting the
Dipentra detail. </p>

<p class="Story">Eric laughed. &#147;Well,
this would be the place to get it,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter hunched
over, put his hands on his thighs. It was just for a moment. He just needed
to suck the last bit of pain down. And&#133; <i>done. </i>It was gone. Walter
stood up.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just a small
cramp, hotel coffee,&#148; Walter said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ah,&#148; Eric said. &#147;Well, if you need to go back to your hotel room and lay down, we&#8217;re not on
lockdown here. You should take care of your health.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Before Walter could
tease him about the irony of this advice, Eric was gone. Eric&#8217;s cologne, a
prestige brand that cost $500 a bottle, lingered, sweetened the air that Walter
breathed like fear after a bad dream.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Walter blamed everything that had gone
wrong at the Dipentra conference on the protestors. Two weeks later, sitting
at home with a cold beer and box of hot pizza and watching the election results
come in, he had already successfully forgotten about his awkward exchange
with Eric Mulrhony, having written off the entire weekend as sabotaged by evil
San Francisco hippies.</p>

<p class="Story">The West Virginia
and Maryland polls had closed and exit poll results were coming in. Most of
the news outlets&#8217; focus was on the presidential race and voter sentiment
regarding the Iraq war, but CNN&#8217;s doctor-turned-commentator, Dr. Edmund Ahn, a
Korean-American heart surgeon from La Jolla, discussed the two
drug sales bills at length. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Pharmaceutical
executives and medical professionals all over the country are watching the West
Virginia and Maryland elections closely this year. Both states are voting on
state propositions to limit the access of drug companies&#8217; marketing departments
to physicians and information about their prescription-writing,&#148;</i> Dr. Ahn said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes, apparently
drug companies right now are able to </i>buy<i> data that tells them which drugs
doctors are prescribing, isn&#8217;t that right?&#148;</i> the CNN anchor said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;That&#8217;s correct,&#148;</i> Dr. Ahn said. <i>&#147;Drug
companies currently use that information to gauge how their sales and marketing
efforts on the ground are working. The West Virginia and Maryland bills, along
with three similar propositions in Minnesota, Iowa, and California, will, if
passed, make that kind of data mining illegal for the doctors in their states.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;So, is this a
privacy issue or a health care issue?&#148;</i> the CNN anchor asked. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Well, it&#8217;s complicated,&#148;</i> Dr. Ahn said. <i>&#147;If
you look at CNN&#8217;s West Virginia exit poll, 66% of people &#8216;agree&#8217; or &#8216;strongly
agree&#8217; with the statement, &#8216;Decisions about prescriptions and medications
should be made only by a doctor and his or her patient.&#8217;&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Dr. Ahn&#8217;s hair had
so much gel in it, it looked plastic. He had a blonde wife, also a doctor, and very pretty: Walter had once seen a
photo of them with their twin mixed-race sons on the internet.</p>

<p class="Story">Dr. Ahn and the
anchor wrapped up their discussion and went to commercial. The first
commercial was the Dipentra commercial with its
classy celebrity spokeswoman, a thirty-second version of the film shown at the
launch. It was incredibly corny and looked like a parody of itself.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter wasn&#8217;t
threatened by TV and internet marketing. No one ever followed TV commercials&#8217;
advice to <i>&#147;ask your health care provider if ___ is right for you.&#148;</i> Doctors drove sales, and sales reps introduced drugs to doctors. </p>

<p class="Story">Besides, everyone
fast-forwarded through commercials now anyway.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter
sat back on his couch and took a few bites of pizza. <i>So much to-do about
nothing. </i>Life was pretty good (great!), but nobody ever seemed satisfied. Take this pizza: the yeasty crust baked to half-chewy, half-crispy-brown
perfection, the tangy red sauce, the sweet, stretchy white cheese sweating
salty oil, all so efficiently presented on three thin layers, cut into
palm-sized wedges and delivered to your front door. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter didn&#8217;t get
why half of his fellow Americans didn&#8217;t experience things like pizza home
delivery and marvel at how wonderful capitalism was. They took it for granted
that you could pick up the phone and order boxes of consistently delicious food
that was then cooked and delivered within thirty minutes to your doorstop, or
that doctors who had been out of medical school for ten years and worked
fifty-hour weeks would know everything that needed to be known about the newest
drugs on the market. Democrats just weren&#8217;t happy people, he thought. They
wanted to be heroes who swooped in and saved the country, even if the country
didn&#8217;t need saving.</p>

<p class="Story">The TV cut back to
the CNN set. There was a cheesy music cue.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Okay,&#148;</i> the CNN anchor
said. <i>&#147;Breaking news, folks. Our post-election analysts have confirmed
that the West Virginia and Maryland state propositions regulating
pharmaceutical companies&#8217; access to physicians&#8217; prescription-writing data and
limiting certain kinds of gifts from sales reps to doctors have both </i>passed<i>. That&#8217;s right, the so-called &#8216;D.A.R.E. bills,&#8217; as they were allegedly called by
pharmaceutical companies, will now become law in West Virginia and Maryland. The people of West Virginia and Maryland have voted to limit pharmaceutical
companies&#8217; influence over physicians practicing in their states.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter closed the lid on his pizza box.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;A huge blow to the
drug industry, Ken,&#148;</i>
Dr. Ahn said. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s phone
rang. Walter went to the desk it was sitting on and looked at the caller ID. It was his old rep, Jim Valiant. Jim was now a manager with GSK in San Jose.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter picked up. &#147;This is Walter,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Doc Choo, it&#8217;s Jim
Valiant. Are you watching?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah,
unbelievable,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s over,&#148; Jim
said. &#147;GSK corporate has been telling us California managers from the
beginning&#151;if West Virginia and Maryland pass, they all pass.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, they can&#8217;t
know that for sure,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;ll
find out soon enough,&#148; Jim said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jim,
it&#8217;s always great to hear from you,&#148; Walter said, &#147;but I haven&#8217;t spoken to you
in at least three years! Why&#8217;d you think of calling me?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because
you&#8217;re the only one I trust right now,&#148; Jim said.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Ben</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">B</span>en had always considered himself a pretty
good judge of character. His technique was simple: he listened to what people
told him about themselves. From jokes about shortcomings to rants about
nightmare coworkers and impassioned discussions about television shows, people
who you didn&#8217;t know told you every day, in public, what they lusted after, what
drove them crazy, what they hated and loved, what they didn&#8217;t understand, what
they didn&#8217;t care to understand, and what they feared. </p>

<p class="Story">His first
impression of Marin had been that she was a reasonable, fun, and happy person
who had a complex attitude towards authority figures. He had been proven, more
or less, correct over the following six years. Marin had her daddy issues, of
course, and her child abandonment issues that stemmed from losing her mother to
cancer when she was fifteen. She&#8217;d actively worked through a lot of this
baggage in college, but she still ran into trouble (Ben believed) when it came
to boundaries in non-lateral relationships. </p>

<p class="Story">During spring break
of their last year of college they had rented a beach house in Venice Beach
with the gang. Late one night, Marin and Ben had stayed up talking in the
kitchen, and Marin had told Ben that her biggest regret in life was that she
and her mother had never gotten to be friends. Around the time that her mother
had become seriously sick, Marin had discovered good music and alternative
culture for the first time. This being the nineties, and Marin being fourteen,
following through on this discovery had involved taking public buses to some
unsavory Chicago neighborhoods to buy CDs and listen to live music. There had
been fights until Marin had become better at lying. The upshot was that she&#8217;d
kept a lot of things from her dying mother. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m
still pretty self-involved,&#148; a twenty-one-year-old Marin had said to Ben,
balancing a tequila bottle upside-down on its cap. She had broken up with her
boyfriend right before they&#8217;d left for Venice Beach.</p>

<p class="last">Marin&#8217;s
fear of not letting other people in enough, Ben thought, had made her
vulnerable in recent years to a series of codependent relationships with
offbeat but charismatic mentor figures: Ray Marcos, that primatologist in
Borneo, Ray Marcos again, and now Gil Garcia.</p>

<p class="first">Garcia was understandably skittish about
all the new attention. He was okay with Ben and Phillip, but awkward around
and, upon occasion, outright hostile to everyone else from Mud23. There had
been grumbling about the &#147;ghetto diva&#148; initially, but then people like Agnes
Mayhew (only the hottest director in indie film at the moment) and the CEO of a
certain internet search engine company started RSVPing &#147;yes&#148; to &#147;Gil Garcia: G
x G.&#148; Everyone understood the stakes and took any abuse from Garcia silently
from then on. </p>

<p class="Story">Garcia
unequivocally adored Marin. Marin had stopped by Mud23 after work a few nights
in September, and she and Garcia had developed a strange connection. Garcia
called Marin &#147;Harriet,&#148; and Marin called Garcia &#147;Mel.&#148; They were both obsessed
with the sandwiches at a visibly unsanitary deli down the street. They had
long and involved discussions about tattoo culture. By October, Marin was
coming to Mud23 three or four times a week. She usually stayed until midnight
or one in the morning, helping Garcia with his sculpture or doing research on
materials, techniques, and visual references for him.</p>

<p class="Story">At home, Judith
expressed worries about Marin and Garcia getting close. &#147;It&#8217;s a conflict of
interest,&#148; she told Ben one night. &#147;She&#8217;s buying what he&#8217;s selling&#151;a personal
relationship is a bad idea.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Phillip and I are
watching her back,&#148; Ben said. &#147;And Charlie is too. He&#8217;s done all this
research and analysis about the contemporary art market. He might be more
excited about Garcia than any of us.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well&#151;and don&#8217;t
take this to mean that I don&#8217;t think that you know what you&#8217;re doing, I believe
you&#8217;re totally brilliant, you know that&#151;but what if Phillip and you are the
ones whose backs need to be watched? Marin is your friend, and you trust her,
but people change when the stakes change. It&#8217;s very easy to say, &#8216;that guy was
just a college friend,&#8217; when serious money or success or whatever is on the
line. What if the party that you and Mud23 are lending your time, resources,
and names to <i>for free</i> sets up Garcia as a big new artist, and then Marin
and he and Charlie go off to sell the work on their own?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That just wouldn&#8217;t
happen,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Not just because Marin wouldn&#8217;t screw people over like
that, but she wouldn&#8217;t have any buyers. Art people&#133; it&#8217;s a different culture
than politics.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Then why doesn&#8217;t
Garcia sign a contract with Mud23?&#148; Judith said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, we haven&#8217;t
really given him an ultimatum&#151;sign with us or no launch event&#151;so if you&#8217;re not
being forced to, would you sign a contract?&#148; Ben said. &#147;Especially if you&#8217;re a
paranoid, semi-orphaned, HIV-positive skater punk from the ghetto?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I love you,&#148;
Judith said, and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p class="last">She
looked exhausted. Ben told her that he would talk to Phillip about a contract
so that she wouldn&#8217;t worry.</p>

<p class="first">On Friday, October 15, Ben had gone into
MBAD&#8217;s offices during the day to file his two November stories, freeing him
for the rest of the month to work on the Garcia party and his other Mud23
projects full-time. When he got to the gallery at five-thirty-five, there was
a crowd around the open workroom door: Phillip, Marin, and Ben&#8217;s coworkers
Angela, Christine, and Martha. They were talking all at once.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Benjamin!&#148; Phillip
said when he saw him. &#147;You have to come see what our young Mr. Garcia has
done.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Angela
moved aside so that Ben could walk inside the room, where Garcia was squatted
beside a large round red wax altar table with a rimmed top. Skulls had been
carved into the outer edge of the tabletop rim. The altar&#8217;s base had been
molded into an Aztec-style Ouroboros carving: a snake god, tricky and powerful,
drawn in sinister ancient geometries, eating its own tail. It was creepy and
beautiful and would tie everything together perfectly. Ben had to stamp down a
vision of himself (such visions were getting much too frequent these days)
talking to an <i>Artforum</i> reporter about this moment as the moment that he&#8217;d
known that <i>&#147;Garcia had something very special to say.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Usually there are
offerings of marigold flowers, wreaths, food, and pan de muertos,&#148; Garcia
said. &#147;I want to have tiny TVs with images of these things inside and around
the base.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I love the
Ouroboros,&#148; Martha said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it an
anachronism, though?&#148; Phillip asked. &#147;Or maybe a comment on Catholicism? That
it has been its own downfall?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The Day of the
Dead is about the living celebrating the dead,&#148; Garcia said. &#147;The Ouroboros is
the only thing that makes sense, but I think it informs my other themes, yes.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben noticed a bunch
of jar candles in the trash by the door. &#147;What&#8217;s going on with the candles?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I had to throw
out the first three batches,&#148; Garcia said. &#147;Once I started designing the
altar, I knew that I was raising the bar and that stupid <i>Wizard of Oz </i>shit
wasn&#8217;t going to cut it anymore. It&#8217;s not about desire anymore. It&#8217;s about
entropy. The new candles will all be covered with different artists&#8217; tags (by
Rocco and two other kids I know), one over the other, and then scratched out
with a key. A progression towards meaningless ugliness.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I know
where we can get you tiny TVs,&#148; Christine said. &#147;I&#8217;ll make some calls.&#148; She
left.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, see you guys
Monday,&#148; Angela said. &#147;I have a date with a five-year-old and a cartoon
shark.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m out too,&#148;
Martha said. &#147;Exciting stuff, ya&#8217;ll.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Ta-ta</i>,
ladies,&#148; Garcia said, in a nasal falsetto. &#147;<i>Too-da-loo!</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">As Angela and
Martha went to their desks and quickly gathered their things and put their
computers to sleep, Marin walked inside the workroom and climbed backwards onto
one of the folding tables. Sitting on its edge, her feet were one inch off the
ground and she kicked her legs up, together and parallel, once. There was a
scattered pile of CDs next to her, and she picked through them. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, Ben can set up
the third floor studio for you when you need to shoot the offering photos,&#148;
Phillip said to Garcia. &#147;And I&#8217;ll leave a hundred dollars petty cash for you
in your mail slot. I&#8217;m in L.A. Sunday to Thursday to look at some Beecrofts
and do this MOCA thing, but email me if you need anything.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Phillip then turned
and followed an exiting Angela out into the hallway. The front door shut
behind them, and they paused outside the door together, talking. Ben could
hear the occasional out-of-context consonant and low hum of Phillip&#8217;s baritone,
but he and Angela were purposefully talking at a low volume. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mel, why do you
have a Kelly Clarkson CD?&#148; Marin said. She held up the plastic magazine case,
with the photo of the young reality TV star on the cover.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Entropy, Harriet,
entropy,&#148; Garcia said, with a flickering smile. He moved the altar from the
center of the room to the corner and covered it with a white bed sheet. &#147;I
feel like a double ham and white cheese all of a sudden.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good, I&#8217;m
starving,&#148; Marin said. She slid off the table.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia picked his
jacket up from off the floor, shook it once, and slid into it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How&#8217;d dinner go
last night?&#148; Ben asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Weirdly,&#148; Marin
said, sliding her hands into her jacket pockets. &#147;I think I may have
over-instructed Charlie on how to deal with my father. However, things could
have gone much worse. I think everyone survived the evening not
scarred-for-life, so there&#8217;s that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you going to
see your dad again before he leaves?&#148; Ben asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m driving him to
the airport Sunday,&#148; Marin said. &#147;He&#8217;s so busy with the Dipentra launch right
now though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia whistled
three notes slowly&#151;<i>three, blind, mice&#151;</i>a Garcian sign of impatience that
Ben had already heard several times in the past two months.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you coming
with us to deli?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, I have
leftovers from last night in the fridge,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay then, we&#8217;ll
be back,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Garcia
left. Phillip and Angela were no longer in the hallway. The former had
probably gone downstairs for a smoke.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben still saw Marin
as his college buddy, but, as the day of the launch party approached, he
increasingly saw her also as &#147;the money.&#148; As a junior gallery assistant, he
was usually a little bit afraid of the money, and now, sometimes, Ben found
that he was a little bit afraid of Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">After Phillip&#8217;s
initial visit to Garcia&#8217;s studio two months ago, Phillip and Ben had taken Marin back with them to Mud23, empty on a Saturday evening, to speak privately about Garcia and explain
the sales process to her. Nothing had been promised explicitly, but part of the
purpose of the meeting had been to gauge Marin&#8217;s seriousness so that Phillip
could decide how involved Mud23 should be. Marin had made it clear that she
was prepared to buy the entire show for $200,000 if she was not outbid by any
other buyers: she had that much faith in Garcia already. Phillip had then
decided a full-blown launch party was appropriate, but the gallery only made
money if there was a sale. Mud23&#8217;s cut was the standard 40%, and Ben was
pretty sure that he was finished at Mud23 if the gallery didn&#8217;t get its eighty
grand.</p>

<p class="Story">Maybe Judith had
been right. Maybe Garcia had decided that he didn&#8217;t want to give up 40% to The
Man anymore. Maybe that&#8217;s what all of these private trips to the yucky deli were
about. Sure, Garcia couldn&#8217;t sell to Marcus Holland (one of the Mud23
shortlist collectors that Ben had put on the invitation list) on his own, but
he could sell it all to Marin and leave Mud23 and Ben with nothing. </p>

<p class="Story">Or maybe Marin was
the one working Garcia in the deli. Maybe Charlie, in the course of all of his
&#147;research,&#148; had drummed up some East Coast interest in the hot young artist
with the made-for-<i>Vanity-Fair</i> backstory, and Charlie had convinced Marin
that she&#8217;d be much better off taking half of a 40% cut of some amount much
higher than $200,000.</p>

<p class="Story">None of this
sounded right, but Judith was the brilliant strategist, not Ben. Ben had grown
up in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard, a place where the only time people screwed each other
over was the occasional jerky Scrabble move, and even that was only after a few
drinks. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben could see the
top right corner of Christine&#8217;s blonde head from his cubicle. She was typing
an email in her work email account. She disliked Garcia&#8217;s style, so her
decision to stay late on a Friday night to help Garcia with his sculpture was
suspect. </p>

<p class="Story">Phillip came in
with nicotine-glazed eyes, unlocked the safe, and counted out five twenties of
petty cash. He placed them in Garcia&#8217;s box and then went inside his office and
shut the door. What had Phillip&#8217;s conversation with Angela in the hallway been
about? Perhaps everyone suspected Ben of collusion with Marin and Garcia about
something. After all, Ben had set up his first meeting with Garcia with Marin,
not anyone from Mud23. </p>

<p class="Story">This kind of
second-guessing was exhausting and getting Ben nowhere. He didn&#8217;t know how
Judith did it. Perhaps he was his parents&#8217; son after all: just too nice and
too decent to swim with sharks.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben pulled up the
guest list spreadsheet. Twenty-eight out of thirty-five people had already
RSVP&#8217;d &#147;yes,&#148; including thirteen collectors new to Mud23. He was being silly
with all this obsessing about behind-the-scenes machinations. They were all a
team. He should enjoy this part now, the meaningful working part, before
luck and chance&#151;whichever way the pendulum swung&#151;took over.</p>

<p class="Story">Ten minutes later,
Garcia and Marin came back, and Garcia went into the workroom alone clutching a
paper bag by its rolled-down top. Marin came over to the cubicle next to Ben&#8217;s
and sat in his coworker Brian&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So apparently
there were a bunch of &#8216;YES on Prop 66A&#8217; people outside my dad&#8217;s drug launch
today,&#148; Marin said. She didn&#8217;t have food, just a plastic bottle of water which
she screwed open and drank a few gulps of. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sorry,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I&#8217;m sure there were BAARC people there, but Judith&#8217;s actually out of town
until Thursday. She&#8217;s doing some grassroots campaigning for Prop 66A
downstate.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had always been
under the impression that Marin despised her father&#8217;s work, and Ben had been
surprised when, about a month ago, Marin had started making mean little
passive-aggressive jokes about Prop 66A.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s just weird,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I had dinner with him last night, and I didn&#8217;t tell him that I&#8217;m
friends with one of the leaders of this thing that&#8217;s trying to undermine his
life&#8217;s work.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, your
father&#8217;s a really smart guy,&#148; Ben said. He closed the guest list spreadsheet
and spun around in his chair to face her, leaning back and crossing his left
foot to his right knee. &#147;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s got Plan A, B, C, and D all figured
out.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re right. Why
am I worried about Walter Choo?&#148; Marin said. &#147;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s found a way to
single-handedly sabotage all five bills by now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did you tell him
about&#133;?&#148; Ben asked, pointing in the direction of the workroom.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No. No, way. Are
you kidding?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye Ben! Bye
Marin! Have a good weekend!&#148; Christine called out.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye!&#148; Ben and
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">She left.</p>

<p class="Story">Phillip emerged
from his office suddenly, half-waved in their direction without looking, said
&#147;Ciao!&#148; and followed Christine out.</p>

<p class="Story">A few seconds
passed in silence. Ben wanted to tell Marin that it wasn&#8217;t appropriate for her
to stay if she wasn&#8217;t helping/appeasing Garcia, but he was afraid of offending
her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Garcia thinks that
those two are having extramarital relations,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, Phillip&#8217;s a
happily married man with two kids,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, Ben, surely
they have infidelity in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re talking to
a happily married man. I know another one when I see one,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Where&#8217;s
your deli food?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, the
first sandwich I picked up had mold on it!&#148; Marin said. &#147;Like serious white
and green fuzz covering the entire bottom slice of bread. Kind of lost my
appetite after that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you want to go
out to eat somewhere? I&#8217;m not really feeling leftovers tonight,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin whispered,
&#147;Can we leave Garcia alone here?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, but we can
make him think it&#8217;s his idea to leave,&#148; Ben whispered.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh brother, not
you too with the mind games. Why does every man in my life have to play mind
games?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s not a mind
game. We&#8217;ll just remind him what he&#8217;s missing being stuck here with us on a
Friday night,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Laugh really loudly like I just said the funniest
thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Make me,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are you, four
years old?&#148; Ben said, before standing, reaching over quickly, and tickling her
belly with both hands. &#147;Goochie goochie goochie goo!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, you&#8217;re
such a freak!&#148; Marin said, swatting him away but laughing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You asked for it,&#148;
Ben said. He sat back down in his own chair. &#147;Like, literally.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Shhh&#133;</i>&#148;
Marin said. She whispered, &#147;Garcia&#8217;s going to think we&#8217;re having extramarital relations.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben raised his
finger to his lips, mimed typing, and pointed to his computer screen. They
both started fiddling with their computers and pretending to look intently into
the monitors. Not five seconds later, the door to the workroom burst open,
banging the outside wall, and Garcia came out with his jacket on and an Oakland
A&#8217;s cap hermetically sluiced onto his head.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;See you Monday,
kids!&#148; Garcia called out without looking, giving a little half-wave, just like
Phillip.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye, Mel!&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Bye,
Garcia,&#148; Ben said. He waited for the weighted gallery door to slam shut. &#147;Let&#8217;s eat,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="first">Thirty minutes later, Marin was driving Ben
over the Bay Bridge to meet Jorge and possibly Nazneen and Max for deep dish
pizza in downtown Berkeley. Ben had called Jorge first; Jorge was free and
said he&#8217;d call Nazneen, whom none of them had seen since Ben&#8217;s wedding. Ben
and Marin had called Max on speakerphone and left a voice message.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is exciting,&#148;
Ben said. &#147;You, me, and The George, just like old times.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m nervous about
the Garcia party,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know,&#148; Ben
said. &#147;I am too.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">That was the last
thing that either of them said until they pulled into an empty parking spot in
front of the pizzeria. Jorge was sitting at a table in the corner with a huge
stack of huge menus. When Ben and Marin sat down with him, both of their phones
buzzed with texts at the same time.</p>

<p class="last">Ben pulled
out his phone and opened the message: </p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Gng well down </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>here. Miss u, </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>love u, xxx J</i></p>

<p class="posttxt">&#147;It&#8217;s
Judith,&#148; he said, thumbing out his response:</p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Things good</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>here 2. GXG</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>sculpture </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>coming 2gther. </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Be safe, love B</i></p>

<p class="posttxt" style="margin-bottom:0">&#147;Mine&#8217;s Charlie,&#148;
Marin said, clicking through the message and smiling as she put away her
phone. &#147;He says &#8216;hi.&#8217;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You guys are both,
just, <i>ew</i>,&#148; Jorge said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s that? I
thought that you wouldn&#8217;t want to live in a world where Judith and I and our
love for each other didn&#8217;t exist,&#148; Ben said. He had kind of memorized both
Jorge&#8217;s and Anastasia&#8217;s reception toasts.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, but that
doesn&#8217;t mean that I enjoy being the only text-free party at the table,&#148; Jorge said.</p>

<p class="last">Ben
still had his thumbs in texting position, so he pulled up Jorge&#8217;s most recent
text to him and replied:</p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Jorge ur so </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>sexxxxy. OMG </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>ur like the half-</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Mexican Brad </i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Pitt!</i></p>

<p class="posttxt" style="margin-bottom:0">Jorge&#8217;s phone
buzzed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I am so not
opening whatever obscene message you just sent me,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;Nazneen can&#8217;t
make it, by the way. She has a date with a guy that she met in Tahoe.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s
right. I knew that,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I don&#8217;t think Max is coming either.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where is Charles
in Charge anyway?&#148; Jorge asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, he has a pitch
meeting next Monday so he wants to do as much prep as he can for that tonight
so that he doesn&#8217;t have to worry about it over the weekend,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Their waitress
came, and they ordered what they always ordered at this pizzeria: a large deep
dish pizza with sausage, onions, and peppers and a pitcher of beer. </p>

<p class="Story">To know exactly the
good thing that you were going to be getting, and to be able to attune your
anticipation with incredible specification and without the threat of
disappointment: this was one of life&#8217;s most underrated pleasures. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin put her head
on Jorge&#8217;s shoulder, and he patted it tenderly. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben, who do you
think has weirder taste in men: me or Jorge?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You guys have
equally interesting romantic lives in different ways,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That is the
triangulation of a consummate professional. Ben, you should really consider
going to law school,&#148; Jorge said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Especially since
you could fart on your application and get into Harvard,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">They laughed at
this&#151;&#147;fart&#148; and &#147;Harvard&#148; in the same sentence was never not funny. </p>

<p class="Story">The night, all
this, felt small, but in a good way, like a stretched-out sweater washed and
dried back into its original springy and snug shape.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben was on the
verge of so much unfamiliar territory in his career, and it was natural that
being at an old hangout with old friends should feel good to him right now. The momentum of his life was still directed forward; he still wanted his
grown-up apartment and life with Judith at the end of the day.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had meant what
he&#8217;d said to Jorge in the Mandala Center conference room on his wedding day,
but his sentimental little speech had also been goodbye, in a way. He had
tacitly given Jorge and himself permission to grow apart. Meanwhile, the
Garcia party would forever change Ben&#8217;s relationship with Marin, and possibly
not for good. That they were both comfortable with this happening showed how
far apart he and Marin had already grown. </p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Judith&#8217;s cellphone rang at five-forty the
morning of November 2&#151;she had switched it to the most annoying of her phone&#8217;s
preloaded ringtones about two weeks ago, after she&#8217;d missed an important call
from her community outreach manager, Fred, while in a loud restaurant with Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">BEE-be-BEE-BEE-dee-DEE-dee-DEE-DEEDYDEEDY-BEE-be-DEEDYDEEDY-be-BEE-BEE,
the tiny machine bleeped out psychotically, before starting over again at the
top.</p>

<p class="Story">BEE-be-BEE-BEE-dee-DEE-dee-DEE-DEEDYDEEDY&#151;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeth on
sichthy-sichth ehgg,&#148; Judith croaked. </p>

<p class="Story">&#151;BEE-be-DEEDYDEEDY-be-BEE-BEE!</p>

<p class="Story">Without sitting up,
she picked up the phone and pressed answer. &#147;Nhith is Judith,&#148; she said. She
fumbled for the box of tissues on her bedside table, pulled out two, and blew
her histamine-flooded nose into them. Judith&#8217;s allergies acted up when she
didn&#8217;t get her seven hours of sleep a night.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben slowly regained
consciousness as Judith talked to Fred about strategies for deploying their
army of &#147;YES on 66A&#148; election day volunteers. As he did, Ben started
remembering some of the three hundred things that he needed to do before
the Garcia party that night. He had been dreaming about something slow and pleasant and
sweet and wanted to go back there. If he got up, he would have to start doing
some of the things that he needed to do, and he would not be able to do any of
them fast enough. He rolled over and placed his hand on Judith&#8217;s knee (she was
now sitting cross-legged on top of the duvet and talking very fast and
commandingly to Fred). That made Ben feel better. It was a nice knee: soft
and smooth.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith covered the
mouthpiece of the phone. &#147;Babe,&#148; she said to Ben. &#147;I&#8217;m going to be on with
Fred for awhile so you can hop in the shower if you want.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">This
shouldn&#8217;t have hurt Ben&#8217;s feelings, but it did. However, the experience of feeling
hurt pinched Ben awake into full consciousness, and he got up, went into the
bathroom, and turned on the shower water. The hot water started to steam, and
Ben undressed and stepped into the tub, sliding the door closed behind him. As
he turned a bar of soap in the lines of water streaming from the shower head,
wetting it and producing a creamy lather, Ben began to mentally delegate parts
of his to-do list away to the other Mud23 staffers, to Phillip and Garcia even,
and found a confidence and a readiness that were much better than the pleasant,
slow feeling of his dream.</p>

<p class="first">The rest of the day ran unreasonably
smoothly, like warm grease rolling down the tipped bottom of a pan. Ben&#8217;s
coworkers, in particular, really came through. They did everything he asked
them to without fuss, and took care of small problems brilliantly and without
bothering him. On most Mud23 shows, everyone tended to keep score about the
amount of work that everyone else was putting in relative to their own, but the
run up to &#147;Gil Garcia: G x G&#148; felt like a real team effort. From small things
that they said and did, Ben got the feeling that everyone else seemed to
believe, with not inconsiderable excitement, that they could be making history.</p>

<p class="Story">At three o&#8217;clock, a
teenager wearing a Kerry-Edwards shirt came to the gallery with an In-n-Out bag
that had Ben&#8217;s name written across the top in permanent marker. Inside was a
cheeseburger, two bags of Ben&#8217;s favorite tea, and a note from Judith that said:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="first"><i>Wish I could have
brought this myself. Hope things go well, and I know that whatever happens
you&#8217;ve done me proud. I love you (and <u>MISS</u> you!) and can&#8217;t wait to see
you and hear all about it tonight. </i></p>

<p class="thanks"><i>-J </i></p>

<p class="first"><i>P.S.&#151;You don&#8217;t have
to vote if you don&#8217;t have time&#133; really. (One time exception only, though!)</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story">Ben ate the
cheeseburger in five bites. He rinsed out his coffee mug, opened both bags of
tea, dropped both into the mug, filled the mug with hot water, brought it to
his desk, and let the tea steep while he made some final changes to the bio of
Garcia that they were going to hand out to the guests. He printed the new
version:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">Gil Garcia was born
Gilbert Xavier Garcia on February 8, 1975 in San Francisco, California. He was
raised by his mother, Imelda Garcia, an office cleaner and waitress. They
lived in a one bedroom apartment on Mission Street, where Imelda was active in
the local mural painting community. (She contributed anonymously to the iconic
Clarion Alley mural, <i>El Diario de Las Chicanas</i>.)</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">In 1994, during a
prolonged manic episode, Imelda spent her life&#8217;s savings to buy a house, in
cash, in Bayview-Hunters Point, where Garcia lives today. Three months later,
she disappeared. She is presumed to be living homeless in the East Bay.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">Garcia dropped out
of high school one year later, eight credits shy of his high school diploma. He worked a series of odd jobs, including: copy boy, concession salesman at
Giants Stadium, dish washer, and bike messenger. He was diagnosed with HIV in
1997.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">In 1998, Garcia
picked up his first can of spray paint and tagged his initials onto an
abandoned building in South San Francisco. He taught himself oil painting from
books and images that his mother had left behind. </p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:0t">Bay Area street artist Rocco Morris has
called Garcia &#147;the future of California street art&#148; due to Garcia&#8217;s strong
point of view incorporating both of San Francisco&#8217;s two great street art
traditions: graffiti art and muralismo. Mud23 is pleased to present the
first-ever public viewing of Garcia&#8217;s work, &#147;Gil Garcia: G x G.&#148;</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where&#8217;s Ben?&#148;
someone called out in the other room.</p>

<p class="Story">Angela came into
the office a few seconds later and said, &#147;Ben, Christine, Brian, come out to
the gallery, you have to see.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The three of them
got up and followed Angela back out to the gallery. Light tarps had been
hanging over Garcia&#8217;s paintings (returned from the framers and hung last night)
all day while their contract engineer had constructed a small dais for Garcia&#8217;s
sculpture in the middle of the floor. Garcia had spent since noon installing
the altar sculpture on the dais and working out technical kinks. He had
finished, finally, and the tarps had been removed from the paintings.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had seen many,
many art exhibits in his time and over twenty in this exact same space. His
person feelings towards Garcia over the past few months had included curiosity,
amusement, irritation, ambivalence, mild fear, and (very occasionally)
disgust. However, there was no arguing at this moment that the man was a
genius. </p>

<p class="Story">On the white walls
hung sixteen colorful, evocative paintings in the child-savant-like style of
California muralismo, depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe, the resurrection of
Christ, John the Baptist, village life in Mexico, and Mexican laborers on
California farms: in each painting, where the sun or blast of holy water or
light should have been was a painstakingly detailed image of a bottle of HIV
medication. Equal parts sardonic and hopeful, funny and sorrowful, Garcia&#8217;s
work erased the artificial lines between. In the center of the room was the
blood-red wax altar with thirty jar candles fitted into the rimmed,
skull-studded top. The candle jars&#8217; original images had been carefully
bleached by Garcia, leaving only a quarter-inch outline of the Virgin, or
Jesus, or whomever, and then tagged in succession by three famous local
graffiti artists in black. &#147;GXG&#148; had been tagged in red on top. The completed
effect was dense with glittery damning. Small security TVs with five-inch
screens were piled into the empty circle inside the ring of the self-mocking,
diamond-eyed Ouroboros. The TV screens were lit up with black-and-white
digital photos of typical D&#237;a de los Muertos offerings to the dead&#151;a single
marigold blossom with its mandala of teardrop-sized petals, a round loaf of pan
de muertos&#151;as well as color photos of pills arranged in mosaic-ed images of
these objects. Garcia had photographed the items against a black backdrop with
a 50-millimeter macro lens to emphasize the picturesque inadequacy of each
object. In seventeen works, Garcia had condensed the major currents of San
Francisco&#8217;s Mexican-American community and his own life with remarkable
precision and finesse.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s very
important work,&#148; Angela said, brushing the length of her own collarbone with
her fingertips, like a harpist strumming the same chord over and over.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s Warhol meets
Gonzalez-Torres,&#148; said Brian. &#147;No, Frieda Kahlo meets Banksy.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Call
Rocco,&#148; said Phillip. &#147;He&#8217;ll want to see this right away.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Agnes Mayhew looked every part the It Girl
filmmaker in a vintage Dior cocktail dress and cowboy boots. She had brought
her brother Rick Mayhew, the poet/L.A. nightclub owner, with her, and they
walked around the gallery with their arms linked. At every painting, they
stopped, and Agnes stood on her tiptoes and whispered in her brother&#8217;s ear. He
nodded, smiled, and laughed, but never seemed to say anything in response.</p>

<p class="Story">The internet search
company CEO had brought his wife, his former employee. They were both
extremely prepared, asking Ben all the right questions about Garcia&#8217;s
influences and process. Despite having a higher net worth than anyone else in
the room (and 99% of the world) they had succumbed to a latent physical
awkwardness early in the night, often getting stuck with a sideways view of the
work, unable or unwilling to ask their fellow guests to give them the center
spot for a few seconds.</p>

<p class="Story">One of Mud23&#8217;s
regular collectors, Sammy Frampton, the founder-owner of a ubiquitous
West Coast smoothie franchise, had come alone. According to Mud23&#8217;s dossier on
him, Frampton had built himself a futuristic, gadget-filled cliff-side mansion
in Santa Cruz in 2000, including a hidden room where he kept a few bottles of
expensive scotch, Cuban cigars, and some Hockneys and Ruschas. Ben&#8217;s coworker
Christine had been tasked with keeping Frampton away
from Agnes Mayhew, but he seemed more interested in updating the room on the
election results that his personal assistant emailed him every few minutes on
his handheld communication device.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Spread the word,&#148;
he&#8217;d whisper to a group next to him. &#147;Virginia just went to Bush.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Pretty soon the
other suits had gathered around Frampton in one corner of the gallery,
whispering their predictions for the presidential race. There were no hard
numbers to crunch on Garcia or his work, so Ben doubted that any of them would
buy tonight. They&#8217;d probably just come for the free tequila.</p>

<p class="Story">The director of
SFMoMA, Marianna Rioja, was always invited to Mud23&#8217;s openings and events, and
she and Phillip saw each other frequently at art parties and SFMoMA events, but
the Garcia party was apparently the first time that Rioja had set foot inside
Mud23. Born and raised in Madrid and educated at the Sorbonne, tonight Rioja
was ageless in a white shirt dress and brown snakeskin pumps. Three sterling
silver rungs of a necklace hung just above her freckled cleavage. She clutched
at the bottom two with her tiny turquoise-hooded fingers as she squinted
unemotively at Garcia&#8217;s paintings behind Prada reading glasses. </p>

<p class="Story">Rioja made one
efficient round of the work and spent the rest of the evening talking to
Mud23&#8217;s sole top-shelf collector, Alastair Gray. Gray was the debonair scion
of perfume and cosmetics mogul and sixties style icon Juliet Gray and financier
Robert Razhagi. Fifty-eight, Alastair was semi-retired from his role as CFO of
his mother&#8217;s company, and split his time between Montauk, New York and
Monterrey, California. He had sizable modern and contemporary art collections
in both estates. Gray had been one of the earliest champions of Rocco Morris
at the start of his career, even though, charmingly, he seemed to understand
Rocco&#8217;s aesthetic on a purely intellectual level. About one of Rocco&#8217;s most
controversial works&#151;<i>Sambo Smurf</i>, a graffiti painting of a Smurf with the
exaggerated minstrel features of a blackface Sambo caricature&#151;Gray had once
launched into a seven-minute deconstruction of the work that had included
references to Jungian analytical psychology and Schopenhauer&#8217;s theory of art as
a conduit for the transcendence of individual egoism, and had ended with the
sentence: <i>&#147;the unreal blue and the unreal blackface, the children&#8217;s fantasia
and the systematic dehumanization of an entire race of people are fused
together in a darkly comic commentary on the role of visual media in American
society through the ages.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">If Ben wasn&#8217;t
mistaken, the thirty-eight-year-old Rioja was flirting with the recently
divorced Gray. It wasn&#8217;t lost on Ben that Gray was four years older than Ben&#8217;s
father and Rioja was two years older than Judith. However, that was hardly the most surreal
detail in a room that increasingly embodied that old joke about art parties: <i>you
know you&#8217;re at a good one when it reminds you of high school.</i></p>

<p class="Story">Phillip came over
to Ben with a pastel tres leches box in each hand, the handle of a tiny plastic
spoon sticking out of each. &#147;These are so fabulous, Ben,&#148; Phillip said. &#147;Even
Garcia had <i>three</i>. Come on, let&#8217;s see if we can loosen Ms. Rioja&#8217;s
tongue with one of these.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben followed
Phillip to the corner where Rioja and Gray were standing and each holding a
glass tumbler whose bottom slicked with a swallow of gold liquor.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marianna,
Alastair, have you tried these delicious cakes from Lisbeth Rose Bakehouse
yet?&#148; Phillip said.</p>

<p class="Story">Gray followed
Rioja&#8217;s lead, and they both drank their tequila and handed their glasses to
Ben. He took them, and Gray and Rioja each took one of the boxes of cake that
Phillip held out.</p>

<p class="Story">Rioja took a small
bite, and raised her eyebrows, nodding once in approbation. She swallowed. &#147;I
was just telling Alastair how important this work is,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it&#8217;s the
modern Sistine Chapel, isn&#8217;t it?&#148; Phillip said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes!&#148; Rioja said. &#147;I was just saying that. Antiretroviral drugs as the Creation of Man.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Adam touching
God,&#148; Phillip said, &#147;except with a Situationist detournement &#8216;poof!&#8217;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Gray nodded
gravely. &#147;Very bizarre what happened with his mother,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben left quietly
and slid through the crowd to the (closed) back office. He put the glasses in
empty slots in a plastic dishwashing crate on a table in Christine&#8217;s cubicle. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben went back out
to the gallery and surveyed the room. Marin and Charlie were talking to Marcus
Holland, Charlie&#8217;s family friend. Rocco
was nearby them talking to the two other local street artists who had tagged
Garcia&#8217;s candles&#151;Stephan Lee and Merritt Jordan. Rocco, Stephan, and Merritt
had collaborated on a street art installation for a special presentation at the
Venice Biennale two years ago. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben approached
their group&#151;he&#8217;d actually never met Lee or Jordan, who were both based in New
York now. Rocco introduced Ben to them. They both already seemed to be
familiar with his name and his role in the Garcia project.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know,
ordinarily I feel a little bit grouchy at these kinds of &#8216;rising star&#8217; bullshit
events,&#148; Lee said, &#147;but Garcia really deserves the attention.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The place where
his art comes from is so real,&#148; Jordan said. &#147;That&#8217;s so rare these days. Even
with street art.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben&#8217;s coworker
Angela came over and pulled Ben aside. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Agnes Mayhew wants
to buy <i>Unt&#237;tlede #4</i> for twenty-two k,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you serious? I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s you-know-who&#8217;s favorite too,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">Angela immediately
turned and sidestepped Sammy Frampton&#8217;s group and headed towards Phillip at the
other end of the room. Ben, uncharacteristically slow to realize what was
going on, stepped around the Frampton group as well, but Phillip and Angela
were already headed back over together as Ben started crossing the room. </p>

<p class="Story">The three of them
went into the back, into Phillip&#8217;s office, and closed the door. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Agnes will get the
painting for twenty-two,&#148; Phillip said. &#147;We&#8217;ll cut our fee to thirty for
anything else the Search King and his wife want to buy. I guess we&#8217;ll need some of
these.&#148; Phillip opened his desk drawer and took out two sheets of red dot
stickers.</p>

<p class="Story">When Ben, Phillip,
and Angela returned to the gallery, Garcia was talking to Merritt Jordan and
Rocco. His eyes followed Angela as she walked briskly to <i>Unt&#237;tlede #4</i>
and put a red dot under its title card. </p>

<p class="Story">Thirty minutes
later, Ben put three more red dots under <i>Unt&#237;tlede #1, Unt&#237;tlede #9</i>, and
<i>Unt&#237;tlede #17</i> (the sculpture). Garcia watched him, looked suspicious,
looked sick, looked like he was taking in a big, slow, calming yoga breath, but
instead began hyperventilating. He ran out into the hall, his right palm
starfish-flat against his chest. The gallery door wound closed behind him, and
the room broke out into a confused clamor of speculation.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben looked over at
Phillip and saw him mouth the words, <i>Go out there with Marin, please. </i>Phillip
had to have been the best-bred college drop-out in the world; even his panicked
orders were polite.<i> </i></p>

<p class="Story">Ben looked at
Marin, and he saw her understand him. She extracted herself from a
conversation with Charlie, Stephan Lee, and a collector and followed Ben out
into the hall.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia was sitting
very still on the floor, holding his legs to his chest with both arms. His
head was down, and his forehead was pressed against his knees. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mel, dear,&#148; Marin
said, crouching down beside Garcia and putting a hand on his bony shoulder. &#147;Everything&#8217;s going awesome. What&#8217;s wrong?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia lifted his
head and looked at her. &#147;It&#8217;s too much, Harriet,&#148; he said. &#147;I-I need the
money. I deserve the money, I know, but it&#8217;s too much.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What if Marin buys
everything from you?&#148; Ben said. &#147;You know her. It&#8217;s not like selling it to a
complete stranger. She&#8217;ll buy everything and worry about the next step. You
trust Marin, right?&#148; Ben squatted, put his hands on his own knees.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben, I don&#8217;t&#151;&#148;
Marin started.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But you&#8217;ve already
sold stuff to other people, right?&#148; Garcia said. &#147;I saw you put the red dots.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just oral
agreements,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Nothing is sold until the insurance companies go over
everything three hundred times, believe me. Phillip can get them to wait a
little longer. Marin can buy everything for two hundred k, Mud23 will take a
40% cut, and you can take home your $120,000 as early as next week. Or, you
can play the game and make a lot more than that. It&#8217;s your work, and it&#8217;s
tough to see it sold like this, like it&#8217;s meat or something. I get that. A
lot of artists feel like they&#8217;re selling themselves at these things, but it&#8217;s
just money and it&#8217;s up to you. You have the power here, Garcia.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is that weird
though? If after all of this I sell it all to Harriet?&#148; Garcia asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Phillip is the
master at making the weird seem totally natural,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Believe me. Is
that what you want to do? Sell everything to Marin?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The sentience in
Garcia&#8217;s eyes seemed to flutter on and off, like a flickering light bulb.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If she wants it
still,&#148; he said. &#147;Do you?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They both looked at
Marin. She smiled.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Hell,
yeah,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="first">Ben called a cab for Garcia, and Marin
walked him out. Ben went back into the gallery, and let Phillip know what
Garcia had decided. Together they smoothed over the incident citing &#147;pulmonary
side effects from new medication.&#148; They quietly retracted the sales that had
been made while promising Agnes Mayhew and the search engine company CEO that
they would get their paintings and sculpture, but that the &#147;purchasing
structure&#148; would have to be &#147;amended&#148; due to &#147;special considerations for the
artist&#8217;s schedule.&#148; If anything, Garcia&#8217;s sudden fit and exit, and Mud23&#8217;s
consequent vague backtracking only served to bolster Garcia&#8217;s mystique as an
authentic artistic soul too sensitive for the gauche selling of his work to the
highest bidder. </p>

<p class="Story">And this mystique
made everyone want it more. Agnes Mayhew suddenly knew Ben&#8217;s full name, and he
had to reassure her three times that he had her number on file and would give
her a call as soon as they were ready to send something to her lawyer. </p>

<p class="Story">It took another
hour for everyone to take their final stock of the work and clear out for the
night, but the party still finished one hour earlier than scheduled, at nine
o&#8217;clock. </p>

<p class="Story">Packing up for the
night with his coworkers in their darkened office, Ben felt heavy with data as
he buttoned his jacket and lifted the shoulder strap of his bag over his head. However, he went over the evening&#8217;s unexpected turn of events and found much to
be pleased with himself about. He&#8217;d kept his head about him. And Agnes Mayhew
knew his name!</p>

<p class="last">Ben&#8217;s
newly-leased hybrid was where he&#8217;d left it that morning, parked in a spot down
the street. As he got into the driver&#8217;s seat and pressed the power button, the
realization dawned on him that he would get to be with Judith when the results
on Prop 66A came in. Ben could anticipate this moment of sybaritic marital
unity as precisely as he could the taste of a piece of sausage, onion, and
pepper deep dish pizza on his tongue: the weighted look in her eyes, the fierce
indomitableness of her public persona dropping for one second to either the
vulnerability of relief or the vulnerability of disappointment, and the
immediate subsequent delight of realizing what Ben had just realized as he&#8217;d
gotten into his car, that they finally had each other to themselves again.</p>

<p class="first">On the drive home, Ben remembered that
Judith had invited her activist friend Phyl (Phyl managed communications for a
national labor union) and Phyl&#8217;s husband Dave, a legal aid attorney, over to
watch the election results come in. Dave&#8217;s car was parked across the street
from Ben and Judith&#8217;s building when Ben pulled up and parked in an empty spot
in front of it.</p>

<p class="Story">As he climbed the
stairs, Ben could hear the television on in his apartment, and three live
humans talking over it and laughing. He opened the door on Judith lying down
on one couch, her blue-and-yellow Bruins fleece blanket thrown over her legs by
someone else. Phyl was sitting at one end of the other couch, with an
also-prone Dave&#8217;s head in her lap. Dave, too tall for the couch, had his
ankles propped on the ottoman from the armchair in Judith and Ben&#8217;s bedroom. Two bottles of wine were open on the living room table, along with three empty
wine glasses smudged with fingerprints and dried streaks of cabernet, and the
remnants of an enormous order of Indian takeout. There was a cold piece of
naan bread, notably, balanced precariously on the head of a Dick Cheney
bobblehead figurine at the center of the table. The television was set to PBS&#8217;s
live election coverage.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;&#133;and I swear, if I
hear the word &#8216;mandate&#8217; in anyone&#8217;s victory speech tonight I&#8217;m going to
scream,&#148; Judith was saying. &#147;Oh my god, is that really my husband walking
through the door? Is it&#151;it&#8217;s nine twenty?&#148; She sat up and retied her
ponytail. &#147;Do you need food? Alcohol? Tea? A shower?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I need
couch,&#148; Ben said, putting his bag down on the floor and taking his shoes off.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;From someone who
is currently enjoying couch,&#148; Dave said, &#147;couch is an excellent choice. I thoroughly
commend your choice of couch.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Couch is good,&#148;
Phyl agreed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So things went
well tonight,&#148; Ben said. &#147;The artist had a little freak-out, but I think in
the end nobody cared because the work itself was so good.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is Garcia going to
be okay?&#148; Judith asked as Ben sat down beside her and put his hand on her knee.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s just a drama
queen,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, wait, sorry
Ben,&#148; Dave said. &#147;They&#8217;re calling Florida<b>.&#148;</b></p>

<p class="Story">There was a
wordless moan of disappointment as PBS showed the big checkmark next to President
Bush&#8217;s headshot.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;The other big
story tonight is the surprise passage of the West Virginia, Maryland,
Minnesota, and Iowa state bills restricting drug companies&#8217; access to
physicians&#8217; prescription-writing data,&#148;</i> the male pundit said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben looked at his wife. She smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes, that&#8217;s right
Jared, and these bills will also make unlawful the in-kind gifts to
doctors&#151;everything from pens and certain drug samples to expensive trips and
tickets to entertainment events&#151;which have been industry practice for years,&#148;</i> the female pundit
said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;There is one more
similar proposition, Proposition 66A, which California voters voted on today,&#148;</i> Jared said. <i>&#147;Polls
just closed there, but this is now widely expected to pass based on the results
in the other four states.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes, and one of
the stories that&#8217;s starting to come out now is that this was not a true blue
contingent of 100% liberal voters who passed these propositions,&#148;</i> the woman said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;There&#8217;s going to
be a story in </i>Slate<i>
about this tomorrow, right?&#148;</i> Jared said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes, </i>Slate<i> has sent
us an email previewing their story about the large number of evangelical and
Catholic voters who voted for the D.A.R.E. bills as a reaction to what they see
as drug companies&#8217; aggressive marketing to doctors of birth control pills,
especially the morning after pill, which many evangelicals and Catholics regard
as a form of abortion.&#148; </i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Holy shit, Judith,
did you know about this?&#148; Phyl said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fred only called
me at five-thirty this morning about it,&#148; Judith said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Was <i>Slate</i>
going to run it <i>this</i> morning?&#148; asked Phyl.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it wasn&#8217;t
going to be a good story unless it actually worked, right?&#148; Judith said, with a
smirk. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can we get rid of
the Democrats and start a new party with just you and Barack Obama?&#148; Dave said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I remember when we
talked about the evangelical thing at your wedding,&#148; Phyl said. &#147;I thought you
were nuts, frankly. But now I bow down to the master.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You are married to
a bona fide genius, Ben,&#148; Dave said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Judith, you&#8217;re
like the Karl Rove of the Democratic party,&#148; Phyl said. &#147;Except you&#8217;re
not a sociopath,&#148; she added quickly.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben, Judith, and
Dave laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m serious
though. At least who Karl Rove used to be for Bush. Nobody knows your
name outside of San Francisco, but you&#8217;ve just changed health care policy in
five states forever. You started that whole D.A.R.E. bills meme, and look even
PBS is using it for shorthand. And you coordinated a successful grassroots
campaign reaching out to the base of the opposing party through their religious
organizations (and you&#8217;re an atheist). Most importantly, you win things.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben was still
holding on to Judith&#8217;s knee. <i>What </i>evangelical thing?<i> What</i>
D.A.R.E. bills meme? <i>That </i>was what Judith had been doing downstate? It
was one too many stumpers for Ben&#8217;s comfort. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had been
preoccupied with Garcia, and, yes, a certain amount of Judith&#8217;s work world
would always be white noise to Ben, but he hadn&#8217;t not been there for her. He
hadn&#8217;t not been listening. Ben was especially annoyed that he could not now be
certain whether he was upset at <i>not knowing</i> about Judith&#8217;s hardball Prop
66A tactics, or the nature and content of these tactics. Was it his pride that
was offended or his WASPy sense of decorum? And, whichever it was, who wanted
to be that person, in that argument?</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it&#8217;s
California residents who are the winners if Prop 66A passes,&#148; Judith said. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith was the
queen of this kind of conversational <i>wu shu</i>&#151;taking someone else&#8217;s words
and twisting them back at the person to correct or one-up him or her while making
it seem that she was making a benign statement. Ben had always found it
charming: he&#8217;d loved that she was so consistent in her competitiveness; she
couldn&#8217;t even curb it in casual conversation. However, now Ben was overcome
with a blinding, irrational need for inconsistency from his wife, even though
he knew that that was the most unfair thing that he could have wanted, the most
unwinnable marital fight that he could have picked. </p>

<h2>Sarawak : 2003</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he new botanist wasn&#8217;t attractive. He was
fun, however, and Marin was so frustrated with her work these days that being
around fun people was the only time that she ever had fun anymore. </p>

<p class="Story">His name was Nolan
Yap. He was a twenty-seven-year-old Malaysian-Chinese from K.L. He&#8217;d studied
for the past seven years in Dublin, and his accent tended to change
mid-sentence from the rounded, buoyant clucking of his Malaysian youth to the
wide-lipped jawing he&#8217;d picked up in Ireland. Like his predecessor Si-Chee,
Nolan had come to Borneo to do research for his doctoral dissertation.</p>

<p class="Story">At breakfast that
morning in canteen, Nolan had been very excited about some bushes growing in
the jungle outside his bungalow.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Look
what I found just two meters from the back of my bungalow!&#148; he&#8217;d said,
showering a bunch of twigs and leaves onto Will and Marin&#8217;s table. &#147;Malaysia
is the most incredible&#133; a country of botanical wonders! What have I been doing
living in Ireland the past seven years?&#148; </p>

<p class="first">Will didn&#8217;t like him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s too
enthusiastic,&#148; Will said, during his and Marin&#8217;s hike later that day alone. &#147;He&#8217;s over-compensating for something, obviously.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You think he&#8217;s
gay?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; Will said. &#147;More like high-functioning depressive.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If Nolan&#8217;s
depressed, then I need to be more depressed,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I can&#8217;t get any
traction on anything. The Green Action Fund says that they&#8217;re already working
on an oil palm initiative. I didn&#8217;t realize that rainforest conservation and
rainforest conservation were mutually exclusive activities. The Primary Growth
Alliance keeps forwarding me to their $5,000 grant program. I talked for one
hour to a PR rep from N&#233;stle yesterday, trying to wear her down, but I think
she forgot the conversation as soon as it was over.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s voice
caught a little on the word <i>&#147;forgot.&#148;</i> She wondered what neurobiological
connection between the subconscious and speech caused one to start a sentence
in full control of one&#8217;s emotions, everything compartmentalized and rational,
and six sentences later find one&#8217;s self on the verge of tears.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You need a hook,&#148;
said Will. &#147;Something to get them to filter us out of the noise.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin considered
this. &#147;Just don&#8217;t tell me that people &#8216;<i>don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know</i>,&#8217;&#148;
she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;They don&#8217;t,&#148; Will
said. &#147;Except truth, which is known by power. Power is just good at
pretending not to know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And I thought that
I couldn&#8217;t feel any more tautological,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re not
redundant,&#148; Will said, &#147;certainly not to me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And when you come
out of the closet and marry Nolan?&#148; Marin said. &#147;Then what?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&#148;
Will said. &#147;Don&#8217;t even joke about me and Mr. Happypants together. That is
just wrong.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin knew that it
was wrong to blame Will for her failures and frustrations, but she didn&#8217;t think
that she bore full responsibility either. Will&#8217;s irrational dislike of Nolan
was certainly a symptom of the same pathology that prevented Will from
revealing his sexual orientation to their other coworkers, the same pathology
that prevented him from taking Marin&#8217;s work complaints seriously.</p>

<p class="last">What
was it that he had said about failure in their first phone conversation over
one year ago? That because she was young it wouldn&#8217;t matter? In her more
paranoid moments, Marin thought that that was how Will saw her: young and full
of disposable energy and time.</p>

<p class="first">Will and Marin went to O.Q. when they got
back to camp. Will was taking the one- to two-year-old ex-caps out for a
climbing lesson in a jungle clearing near O.Q. The other &#147;teachers,&#148; Malik and
Dilip, were at O.Q. when Will and Marin arrived, letting the &#147;students&#148; out of
their cages and corralling them in the corner opposite the door.</p>

<p class="Story">Even from a
distance, there was no way to mistake the group of young apes for a less
evolved species of mammal. Their proportions and carriage, the elevated
capability and intelligence inherent in the extra architecture in their tiny
hands&#151;there was something fearsome about each of them, young, small, and
vulnerable though they were.</p>

<p class="Story">In the process of
teaching the orangutans skills for surviving in the wild on their own, the
orangutans had to be taught the somewhat contradictory skill of following the
O/URC staff&#8217;s orders. After opening the back door to the clearing, Malik and
Dilip used simple commands and gestures to instruct the ex-caps to head to the
clearing. The orangutans did so in a relatively organized fashion. It helped
that none of them were new students, so they possibly remembered that these
exercises in the clearing involved good fruit planted in the trees.</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin held
up the rear, shooing the stragglers out the door and closing it behind them. When they got to the clearing, Will began speedily rearranging and retying the
ropes that had been left by an older, more advanced class to form easier climbs
for the one- to two-year-olds. Marin sat on the ground cross-legged, watching
the ex-caps play-fight in the clearing as the three humans finished setting up
the ropes. One of the orangutans sniffed out a few lychees stashed within easy
reach on a low branch, and as he peeled and ate all seven of them in a manner
of seconds, an audience of five of his classmates gathered around him, sniffing
the air and trees around him for more easy food. When they realized there was
none, they dispersed and went back to the clearing.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin stood up. She&#8217;d had enough procrastinating for the afternoon. Perhaps there was some
good email waiting for her in office. She walked the short path back to O.Q. and
came upon Nolan inside banging the chain link fence.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, hey, Marin! I
can&#8217;t seem to work this lock right,&#148; Nolan said. &#147;Do I turn the key
clockwise?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin swung the
lock over to her side of the fence and tried to turn the key. It was jammed
slightly, but Marin jiggled it, the key turned, and the lock slid down and open
with a smooth metal thwack.</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan opened the
door and stumbled out clumsily. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s that
English phrase for getting the hang of things?&#148; Nolan asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Um, &#8216;<i>getting
the hang of things?</i>&#8217;&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, it&#8217;s kind of
mathematical&#133; the something slope?&#148; Nolan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, <i>learning
curve</i>,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes! Yes! Steep
learning curve at this place,&#148; Nolan said. &#147;Or maybe it&#8217;s just me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, I&#8217;m right
there with you,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You?&#148; Nolan said. &#147;But you&#8217;re, like, best friends with Dr. St. James, and Dr. Tsai loves you. You know the orangutans by name, and I can&#8217;t even tell the boys from the
girls. You know so much more than me about my own country, and you&#8217;re not even
a scientist.&#148; Nolan&#8217;s voice caught on the word <i>&#147;country.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I sincerely doubt
that,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I&#8217;ve been here more than a year. You&#8217;ve been here five
days. Cut yourself some slack. So what were you doing out in O.Q. by yourself
anyway? Did you want to meet some one-year-old ex-caps?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan nodded
sheepishly, and Marin walked back with him to the clearing. </p>

<p class="Story">There were young
orangutans in the canopy, picking open and nibbling on the bananas, rambutan,
and lychees that had been planted at the top. The air was sweet and bitter
with the flesh and peels of fruit. Dilip was prodding some orangutans in the
trees to swing across a large gap in the canopy one by one. Malik watched him
and recorded observations in a small spiral notebook, and Will worked with five
stragglers on the ropes: Gia, two other girls, and two boys.</p>

<p class="Story">Will reached in his
pocket and pulled out a handful of some kind of nut. The five orangutans on
the ground watched his hand with the nuts closely. Will called out to Malik to
send him an orangutan named Khalid. Malik reached into the trees, pulled out
the young Khalid, and shooed him in the direction of Will. Khalid ran towards
Will, but ran up a nearby tree instead of joining in the lesson.</p>

<p class="Story">Will called Khalid
by name several times, to no avail. Finally, Will popped one of the nuts in
his own mouth, crunching it loudly, and Khalid came running down, play-fighting
with the two male ex-caps upon his arrival. Will tossed one of the nuts up so
that it arced above the slope of the main climbing rope net, and Khalid quickly
ran up the net on all fours, catching the nut in his mouth and chewing it with
the back of his jaw.</p>

<p class="Story">Will waited until
Khalid disappeared into the canopy and threw another nut up the slope of the
net. Gia raced up the net like Khalid, and she caught the nut in her mouth and
chewed it furiously. She ran along a long branch at the top of the net, and
joined some other ex-caps eating from a papaya that had been stashed in a
neighboring tree.</p>

<p class="Story">They heard the
metal chain door of O.Q. open and close, and, five minutes later, Linda and Wan
came into the clearing, Wan shouldering a large black duffel bag. The ripe
sewage-onion-rotted-banana smell of durian warmed the air. Wan had spent the
past few days in an Iban village outside Belaga, helping the villagers
peaceably deter the wild orangutan population in the jungle around their village
from raiding their farms. The village had a legendary two-hundred-year-old
durian tree, whose fruit, if shared among friends, was supposed to bring
incredible prosperity to its consumers within one year.</p>

<p class="Story">Before Wan had left
for Belaga, his staff had all pestered him to bring back some of the &#147;magic
money fruit,&#148; and it appeared that he had. Commotion immediately broke out
among both the human and orangutan contingents in the clearing, and Marin
explained to a confused Nolan what was going on.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan put his bag
down on the ground and zipped it open, revealing eight spike-covered fruits the
size of soccer balls. Linda had put on a pair of gardening gloves. She picked
up one of the durians, walked to a nearby tree, and hit it once against the
trunk, making a large Y-shaped crack on the other side. She pried it open,
took out a pocket knife, and sawed it in half. She handed one half to Malik
and Dilip and the other half to Marin and Nolan and Will.</p>

<p class="Story">Will held onto the
bottom of the shell as Nolan picked up one of the slimy yellow-green pallets<b>
</b>first. He took a bite. &#147;<i>Wow</i>,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#8217;ve had a lot of durian,
but this is&#151;&#148; He took another bite. &#147;That is the most incredible,&#148; he said,
and slurped up the rest of the fruit on his seed.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had tried
durian once on a trip to Hong Kong ten years ago. She remembered thinking that
the taste, although unfamiliar, hadn&#8217;t been that bad, but she&#8217;d hated the
mushy, oily texture of it. Although Marin had seen durian a couple of times at
the O/URC, she hadn&#8217;t felt compelled to try it again with her more mature
palate until now. Marin unstuck a small wet nugget from the shell Will was
holding and took a big bite. </p>

<p class="Story">It was warm. It
tasted cultured, fermented, and had a garlic-like burn to it. And she actually
liked the texture. It was like a piece of slow-roasted meat, so tender it
melted in your mouth.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How is it?&#148; asked
Will, looking skeptical. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Interesting,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I think I like it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Does it feel
magically magical?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can hold the
shell for you,&#148; Nolan said. &#147;You try for yourself and let us know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, okay, <i>&#8216;us,&#8217;</i>&#148;
Will said. He pushed on the edge of one of the nuggets with his thumb, it slid
up with a squish, and he picked it off easily. Will handed the shell to Nolan
and took a bite of the fruit. He chewed and swallowed. &#147;Tastes like onions,&#148;
he said. He sucked the last bit of flesh off the seed in a few bites and then
pitched the seed deep into the jungle behind himself. &#147;Magical onions,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s wrong with
you?&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Huh?&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re so bitchy
today,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Interesting word
choice,&#148; Will said. &#147;Damn, now I want a shot of tuak. Too bad Gandau&#8217;s not
around.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Gandau&#8217;s uncle had
died a few days ago, and he had gone home to his family&#8217;s longhouse for the
funeral.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I don&#8217;t drink
anyway,&#148; Nolan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I didn&#8217;t know,
sorry,&#148; said Will. &#147;May I ask why?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve just never
seen the point of it, to tell you the truth,&#148; Nolan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not even after
seven years in Dublin?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s actually a
lot of Irish people that don&#8217;t like to drink,&#148; Nolan said. &#147;They&#8217;ve seen so
many people from their family struggle with alcoholism, and it kind of turns
you off the stuff, you know?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Wan came over to
their group cradling a whole durian over his belly, followed by four ex-caps. The O/URC&#8217;s digital SLR camera was hanging against Wan&#8217;s hip on a strap hooked
diagonally across his chest. Wan laid the durian down on the ground in front
of Marin and Nolan, and two of the orangutans, Gia and Datok, pawed
ineffectually at its shell. The other two orangutans hung back.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nolan, can you
bang the durian against the ground to crack it, lightly yeah? The orangutans
can open more then,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan picked up the
camera, unhooked the lens cap and let it dangle, and put the viewfinder up
against his eye, turning the lens slightly to focus.</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan handed their
shell to Marin and picked up the new durian and lightly smacked it down. He
raised it to look at the bottom: only the tiniest crack had pierced the shell.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;One more time,
lightly-lah,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan did as he was
told, and, <i>craaack</i>, the durian shell splintered open. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Leave it. Down
like that,&#148; Wan said. &#147;They can turn it themselve.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan left it on
the ground, and the four orangutans approached it for inspection. Gia and
Datok turned it over together, and mounted it to tear off small pieces of
broken shell at the top. Within one minute there was a nice five-inch hole,
and Gia loosened a large piece of flesh. She scurried off to the side to eat.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan walked over to
Gia and squatted in front of her, raising the camera to his face. His finger
pressed down on the photo button, and the camera snapped on a photo of Gia
eating lustily.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Two pieces left,&#148;
Marin said, holding up the half-shell in her hands. &#147;Wan? Nolan? Will?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I had four pieces
in canteen,&#148; Wan said. &#147;That&#8217;s for you three finish.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If we cut a third
off both of them, we can each have two-thirds,&#148; Nolan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s okay,&#148; Will
said. &#147;One was plenty for me. You kids knock yourselves out.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Will went back to
his rope. He picked up a loose strand of rope near the net, tied it to itself,
undid it, and tied it to itself using a different knot.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin held the
durian shell out to Nolan, and he unstuck a piece from it. Marin unstuck the
last. </p>

<p class="Story">She held hers up. &#147;Cheers,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cheers to the most
awesomely fantastic amazing two-hundred-year-old durian fruit, yeah?&#148; Nolan
said.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
giggled: he was a weird, lovable dude, and she would never be able to sleep
with him. Nolan held up his piece of durian, smiled wide, and Wan snapped a
photo of them.</p>

<p class="first">Not ten minutes later, the skies changed
abruptly from sunny and blue with white clouds to dark-gray and green with
gathering spreads of black in the horizon. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How many ex-caps
are out, Will?&#148; Wan called out across the clearing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Twenty-three!&#148;
Will called back. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, everybody
take three ex-caps and go to O.Q. hurry before it starts raining. Will and
Linda, take one more each.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is he serious? I
don&#8217;t think I can even take one!&#148; Nolan said to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Dilip and Malik
will help you,&#148; Marin said. &#147;It&#8217;s just the easiest way to get the count
right. The orangutans certainly don&#8217;t listen to me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, I&#8217;ve got
seven, let&#8217;s go!&#148; Will called out to her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;See?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">She followed Will
towards the path to O.Q. and left Nolan immobilized and confused about whether
to chase down the ex-cap to his right or cross the clearing towards Malik and
Dilip for help.</p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin were
the first ones back to O.Q. Their seven young orangutans squawked at their
caged elders upon their arrival, giddy from their durian feast and the chaos
outside. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s going to be a
bitch to get everyone back in the right cages,&#148; Will said. &#147;Wan shouldn&#8217;t have
panicked like that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">He switched on the
lights&#151;four bare incandescent bulbs hanging from the roof from their wires.</p>

<p class="Story">A loud, low growl
of thunder sent some of the more temperamental orangutans into a tizzy. They
rattled the bars of their cages, yelped, and kiss-squeaked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I just hope the
residence paths don&#8217;t flood again,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nine more
orangutans pattered up the path and into O.Q., followed by Dilip and Linda.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;They can&#8217;t get
Datok and Samira down,&#148; Linda said. &#147;They need a torch.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin went to the
storage locker and pulled out a large yellow flashlight by its rubber-covered
handle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll go back out,&#148;
Dilip said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin handed him
the flashlight, and he turned it on and went back outside to the clearing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s put Gia,
Fatima, Thimbe, Gertie, and Micah in cage one, Joanie, Deirdre, Sammy, Hedda,
and Katja in cage two, and the boys in five,&#148; Linda said. &#147;We&#8217;ll sort everyone
out tomorrow morning.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They did so, and
were herding the boys into cage five when an orangutan named Lyle came bounding
up the path into O.Q., followed by Wan, Malik, and Dilip each holding two
ex-caps in their arms. Nolan, aiming the flashlight into their feet, brought
up the rear.</p>

<p class="Story">Not a second too
soon, because as soon as Nolan shut the door behind himself and looped and
clicked the padlock secure, water splattered loudly onto the roof and down in
thick streams all around them. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Typhoon!&#148; Malik
sang out. He laughed. &#147;Typhoon! Typhoon!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The apes went
apeshit. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Malik&#133;&#148; Dilip
scolded. &#147;I don&#8217;t know why this storm making everyone so crazy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s not the
storm,&#148; Malik said, &#147;it&#8217;s the magic money fruit, man! We getting crazy from
the magics!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Wan and Linda
herded the last seven orangutans into cage eight and locked it shut.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We can all fit on
the three trucks,&#148; Wan said. &#147;Will, you drive Marin. Linda, you drive Nolan. I&#8217;ll drive Dilip, and we&#8217;ll come back and get Malik in the morning.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Tchh</i>&#133; yeah,
right,&#148; Malik said. &#147;My nose can&#8217;t take the wet ape smell, sorry.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Come on, let&#8217;s go
before it gets frea-king muddy out there,&#148; Dilip said.</p>

<p class="Story">They hurried single
file out to the road and piled into the mini trucks as instructed, Dilip and
Malik both squeezing onto the bed of Wan&#8217;s.</p>

<p class="Story">Rain poured down
during the whole ride to the parking lot behind med, but the trucks held up. Water soaked, smothered, and slicked onto and off of Marin with indiscriminate
force and volume. Life, death, joy, pain, love, heartbreak, regret,
confusion: it all happened in an instant, as far as the infinite forces of nature
were concerned.</p>

<p class="Story">They all gathered
soaking wet in canteen, squeezing out their clothes as best they could (and
Marin her ponytail) on the porch, where they left their water-logged shoes as
well. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin went into the
kitchen and filled all three electric water kettles to their maximum fill lines
and turned them on to boil. Will brought four large bottles of Tiger beer out
to the dining room and started pouring glasses and forcing them on people.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin took out
seven mugs, and opened and placed a tea bag in each mug. When the water
finished boiling, she started filling the mugs one-by-one with hot water.</p>

<p class="Story">Will came in
carrying two glasses of beer. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your beer, my
lady,&#148; Will said, placing one glass on the counter next to her.</p>

<p class="Story">The faded
peach-colored cotton-acrylic blend of Will&#8217;s shirt hung wet and slack against
the dense rolls of his arms and chest. He smelled dirty and wild, like
earthworms and decomposing weeds. He drank a third of his beer in one long
trough.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I thought hot tea
would be in order considering how wet and shivery everyone is,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">She was wearing a
black tank top made of a thick spandex-like material. Her upper body wasn&#8217;t
any more exposed than if she&#8217;d been wearing a swimsuit, but she was still
envious at this moment of Linda&#8217;s bulky and waterproof jacket. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s no law
saying you can&#8217;t mix beer and tea,&#148; Will said. &#147;Oh my god, I just had the best
idea! Tuak boilermakers. Am I a genius or am I a genius?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Genius is a loaded
word,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Mad scientist, maybe.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will pulled out his
cellphone and called Anwar and asked him to come to canteen with Gandau&#8217;s tuak.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It. Is. On,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed. &#147;Oh
boy,&#148; she said. &#147;Be very afraid.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin brought her
tray of tea out to the dining room, which exactly only Linda and Nolan were
grateful for. Everyone else was drinking Will&#8217;s beer.</p>

<p class="Story">Among the durians&#8217;
many powers seemed to be an acceleration of metabolism: everyone in the group
got hungry one hour before their normal dinner time. Dilip and Malik led a
movement to raid May&#8217;s prep and storage refrigerator. They doused cold soup
noodles with soy sauce and ate them straight from the pan. They stir-fried
chopped vegetables meant for that night&#8217;s curry and ate them with chopped
boiled eggs, ikan bilis, and coconut rice leftover from that morning&#8217;s nasi
lemak. </p>

<p class="Story">When the foragers
emerged with fuller but not happier stomachs from the kitchen an hour later,
Anwar ran up the steps of the canteen porch wearing an enormous hooded blue
plastic poncho. As he lifted the poncho over his head and it fell to the
ground, they saw his left hand wrapped around the neck of the guitar strapped
across his torso and a large bottle of clear liquid in his right hand.</p>

<p class="Story">The rain-battered
crowd in canteen couldn&#8217;t have been more excited to see Bruce Springsteen
himself.</p>

<p class="Story">Will crossed the
dining room and took the bottle of tuak from Anwar, who strolled to the front
of the room, pulled a chair up, turned it around, sat in it, strummed a few
random chords on his guitar, and then played the opening bars to and started to
sing and play one of those American eighties power ballads whose pop emotions
and nonsensical rhymes (&#147;howl&#148; and &#147;plough,&#148; &#147;toad&#148; and &#147;road&#148;) sounded like
the most trenchant, soul-defining piece of music when sung or heard while
a little bit intoxicated in a foreign country.</p>

<p class="Story">Will poured a glass
of beer for Anwar and then walked around the room with the bottle of tuak,
pouring a large shot in each of his coworkers&#8217; beers. Anwar played the entire
song and then segued immediately into the next, a similar
rock-classic-turned-karaoke-catnip number. </p>

<p class="Story">When song two had
finished, Marin had somehow finished both her tea and her tuak boilermaker. </p>

<p class="Story">As Anwar drank a
sip of his beer and adjusted the tuning on one of his strings, Will started a
chant: &#147;N-D! N-D!&#148; O/URC shorthand for Neil Diamond. </p>

<p class="Story">Everyone joined in,
even Nolan, who couldn&#8217;t possibly have known what they were chanting: &#147;N-D! N-D!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Anwar dropped his
head dramatically, arranged the fingers on his left hand into a chord, and
started picking out the deceptively tentative beginning to that classic N.D.
anthem to no-frills love, <i>Forever in Blue Jeans</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone cheered
and clapped, excited to get what they&#8217;d asked for. Will said &#147;Yes!&#148; and
punched the air with his fist once, and Nolan jumped up and down, hugging
himself.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Money talks&#133;&#148; </i>Anwar sang. </p>

<p class="Story">Everyone joined in
a few lines later, singing the eponymous words together: &#147;<i>forever in blue
jeans&#133;!&#148;</i> Malik sang the synthesizer part&#151;<i>doo doo doo do</i>&#151;at the end
of each phrase.</p>

<p class="Story">Without any
prodding from Will, beer and tuak bottles began circulating around the room,
and everyone topped up their own glasses, feeling compelled to match the
proportions set during the first round. Linda even poured a little bit of beer
in her empty tea cup and sipped at it in between verses. Only Nolan stayed dry. </p>

<p class="Story">Nolan passed the
bottle of tuak to Marin, who poured two glugs into her beer. She passed the
tuak on to Wan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This makes me want
to learn to play guitar,&#148; Nolan said to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sure that
Anwar would love to teach you,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So are you and Dr.
St. James, like, dating?&#148; Nolan asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin smiled,
closed her eyes, and shook her head. She said, &#147;Everyone thinks so, and the
more we protest the more they think we are. I think that it&#8217;s one of those
things that looks right on paper, but we&#8217;re pretty different.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, you are,&#148;
Nolan said.</p>

<p class="Story">This hurt Marin. She&#8217;d always thought of herself and Will as having a lot in common, but Nolan
was right: there wasn&#8217;t that much between her and Will except that they both
were from North America, were relatively young, were a little bit sarcastic,
and knew that he was gay.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What about you,
are you dating anyone?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan sighed. &#147;I
have dating-related drama,&#148; he said. &#147;Kind of a love triangle, and there&#8217;s
this whole messy immigration component too because the girl, Sandra, is an
Indian citizen and she&#8217;s almost finished with her Ph.D. in Ireland? So if she
doesn&#8217;t find a job the only way she can stay in Ireland is to marry her
boyfriend?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, and so I was
hoping that after coming here I&#8217;d just magically get over it and move on, but I
think about her all the time,&#148; Nolan said. &#147;She&#8217;s just the most incredible&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure you
don&#8217;t want a drink?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nolan laughed and
shook his head with a hint of disgust. &#147;Maybe you and Dr. St. James aren&#8217;t so
different after all,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin drank
voluptuously from her glass and went out to the porch. The music had suddenly
lost its charm and sounded like what it was: an amateur musician with a
Malaysian accent covering a song from an album that her father owned in vinyl. The rain had slowed slightly, and Marin could see small birds in the distance
flying through it from tree to tree. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Will and I do
deserve each other</i>,
Marin thought. <i>We both don&#8217;t have lives, and are jealous of anybody who
does&#151;even if that life involves the pain and bureaucracy of international love
triangles.</i></p>

<p class="Story">She finished her
drink. She slipped her feet onto the lower rung of the porch railing, each
foot just fitting in a gap between the vertical wood posts. She balanced there
for a moment, holding onto the smooth ironwood top of the railing with both
hands. Then she let go, came back to the ground.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I was right!&#148;
Will said, stepping onto the porch. He said in a low, but sing-song voice:
&#147;Happypants ain&#8217;t so happy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How do you know?&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;When I asked him
where you were he said that he thought he might have depressed you by moaning
about the state of his love life, and then he went on to describe said love
life in great detail,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Ugh</i>, stop
gloating,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Don&#8217;t you feel bad now that you said you didn&#8217;t like
him?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I never said that
I didn&#8217;t like him,&#148; Will said. &#147;I just thought that his happy act was just an
act, which it was.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will was
suspiciously dry: not as in sober, but as in his clothes and hair were no
longer wet. Marin grabbed the front of her shirt and felt the right hip of her
shorts, and they were cold but she couldn&#8217;t gauge their moisture content. The
nerves in her fingers had been drained of their sensitivity by the alcohol. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are my shorts
still damp?&#148; Marin asked, reaching under the bottom hem of the front of her
right shorts leg and rubbing it between her fingers and thumb.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can&#8217;t tell if my
shorts are still wet or not,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my lord,
Marin,&#148; Will said, laughing with more than a little admiration. &#147;I never
realized what an enormous tease you are.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What? I&#8217;m not
trying to be sexual!&#148; Marin said, laughing. &#147;I just literally can&#8217;t tell if my
shorts are dry or not.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, there&#8217;s no
way for anyone to help you figure that out without molesting you,&#148; Will said. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin held out her
right hip to him. &#147;Just touch the seam with your ring finger or something,&#148;
she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, why do you
even need to know?&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because you&#8217;re
dry, and if I&#8217;m still damp, then that means that somehow you dried faster than
me and that&#8217;s kind of weird, don&#8217;t you think?&#148; Marin said. &#147;Come on, just
touch it for three seconds. I don&#8217;t have cooties.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will reached out
with his right hand, his ring finger extended and his other fingers locked
behind his thumb. As soon as his finger touched Marin&#8217;s hip, they both
exploded with laughter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So was it dry?&#148;
Marin said, before breaking out into an even more uncontrollable peal of
laughter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have no idea!&#148;
Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">The moment passed,
leaving Marin feeling off-center.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey, we haven&#8217;t
played Boggle in forever,&#148; she said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You want to play?&#148;
Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It would be kind
of fun whilst intoxicated,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not
intoxicated,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Uh-huh</i>,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">They smiled at each
other for a moment and then put their sandals back on and walked in long
strides single-file through the soft mizzle wetting the air to Will&#8217;s
bungalow. Will unlocked the door and turned on the lights, and Marin realized
that she hadn&#8217;t been inside his bungalow in a long time. He had moved his
dresser to the back wall of the room by the bed and put up framed photographs
of his family above his bookshelf: Mom and Dad St. James in skiing gear on some
snowy mountaintop; a tr&#233;s chic black-and-white of Will&#8217;s sister smoking and
drinking a latte at an outdoor caf&#233; in front of a thick stack of law books; and
Will and his grandparents on a quilt-covered couch in an old-person living
room.</p>

<p class="Story">Will rummaged
through his wardrobe, pulling open and shutting drawers.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure that
I have the Boggle?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think so,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Hey, can I change into your Gore-Tex? I&#8217;m freezing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, sure,&#148; Will
said. He pulled the jacket off its hanger and tossed it to her.</p>

<p class="Story">She turned around
and pulled off her tank top, put her arms into the jacket&#8217;s huge, long ones and
zipped it up to the top. She sat down on the foot of Will&#8217;s bed, shook her
sandals off onto the ground, and pulled her feet up and under herself.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it in your
dresser?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I only really put
clothes in there, but maybe,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Squatting over the
bottom drawers of the wardrobe, he looked over his shoulder briefly at the
dresser. The unplanned wetting, drying, and partial re-wetting of Will&#8217;s hair
over the past few hours had only made the beauty of his clean Trojan features
that much clearer. And that damn peach shirt.</p>

<p class="Story">Will felt stared
at. &#147;What?&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re just so
darn handsome,&#148; Marin said. &#147;It&#8217;s not fair.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will turned
around. He was kneeling in front of her by the side of the bed and looking at
her in a way that she hadn&#8217;t been looked at for over a year. &#147;And you&#8217;re <i>la
plus belle fille</i>,&#148; he said. &#147;It&#8217;s crazy, I&#8217;ve been so jealous of Nolan all
week&#151;I didn&#8217;t know&#133; I mean, I know I&#8217;ve never&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">He touched Marin&#8217;s
right hip and leaned the whole steady mass of himself over her. His lips
touched hers, and she tasted his small, cold, wet tongue. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin leaned
backwards, pulled her face from his. She didn&#8217;t understand. &#147;Are
you&#151;bisexual?&#148; she asked. Her heart beat about twenty times as she looked into
his tea-brown eyes and waited for him to answer. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Who knew?&#148; Will
said.</p>

<p class="Story">He unzipped the
Gore-Tex.</p>

<p class="Story">In a dark and
directly inaccessible fold of Marin&#8217;s brain, among a childhood visit to an
amusement park that had ended in a vomited corn dog in a flower bed and a
racist epithet from a park attendant, among various lies, betrayals,
inconsistencies, and meannesses that Marin herself been liable for throughout
the years, was stashed the undeniable fact that she wanted Will, unavailable
and impossible a possibility as she&#8217;d thought he was to her. She&#8217;d known what
she hadn&#8217;t wanted to know. </p>

<p class="last">Will&#8217;s
hand slid gently over her breast, and the peach shirt came off, followed
closely by Marin&#8217;s shorts and underwear. Marin could feel Will&#8217;s
four-chambered blood-pumper thudding softly in his cobblestone chest, and he
kissed her neck. His sweat smelled like pond water, and his stomach was warm. Will&#8217;s cargo shorts dropped to the floor, the last sand bag. Will mumbled
Marin&#8217;s name as he pushed inside her, and it all felt so familiar, like
instinct, like dipterocarp bark in the hands of an orangutan, that Marin
couldn&#8217;t believe that she&#8217;d had enough self-control up until this point to keep
her mouth and hands off of him.</p>

<p class="first">Marin woke to the
sound of Will banging his wardrobe door open. It was morning, and there was
some light outside, but it was still early&#151;not later than six-thirty. Will put
on his robe and pulled his shower caddy off of a shelf.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey,&#148; she said. She wiped dried eye goo from her eyes with the back of her hand.</p>

<p class="Story">Will sat down on
the bed beside her. &#147;Morning, Cali,&#148; he said. &#147;I have a hike with Linda in
Section C today. You&#8217;re going to be in office most of the day, I assume?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Assume away,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, I&#8217;ll look
for you there then when I get back,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">He closed his eyes
and kissed her once on the lips. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin waited for
him to leave and shut the door behind himself before starting to panic. </p>

<p class="Story">She had been so
stupid. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Of course</i> Will wasn&#8217;t
bisexual. </p>

<p class="Story">She found her
muggy, cheese-smelling clothes on the floor and dressed.</p>

<p class="Story">She was almost to
her own porch when her cheeks wetted with two tiny saltwater brooks. She
hurried onto the porch and could hardly see the key shaking in her hands as she
slotted it into the padlock on her door. She closed the door behind her and
drew the shades. </p>

<p class="Story">She stood there in
front of the drawn shades as her face leaked more saltwater and mucus, and she
hugged herself. Her body felt foreign to her; she was a changeling unto
herself. <i>What the fuck did I do?</i>&#151;she thought, although she remembered
every part of it. The hand placed carefully where half an hour before he&#8217;d not
even wanted to touch a finger. The kiss. His non-answer to her very important
question. The most intense orgasm she&#8217;d ever had: a year&#8217;s worth of sexual
tension crashing inside her in gorgeously receding waves. <i>No, no, no, no,
no. </i>The wrongness of what had happened lodged itself in the hard wooden
throne of her brain and refused to abdicate its position to reality.</p>

<p class="Story">At first she
thought she&#8217;d imagined the scream. She&#8217;d gone crazy. It was the sound of her
rational mind shutting down and screeching in exodus. However, that scream
would have been wordless, animal pain. This scream had words, a grammatically
correct sentence even: &#147;HELP! SOMETHING HAPPENED IN O.Q. LAST NIGHT! HELP!&#148; Then names: &#147;WAN! WILL! LINDA! HELP!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">It actually hurt
Marin&#8217;s feelings that Will had been called by name and not she. She pulled two
tissues out from the box on her dresser, blew her nose, and dried her face. She opened her wardrobe, pulled a clean T-shirt off the shelf, and changed into
it. She brushed her hair, braided it quickly into pigtails. She left her
bungalow, stepping into the fresh, cool morning for the second time that day,
numb to the dread that she should have been feeling after that scream, and took
a left towards the back path that led to O.Q.</p>

<p class="Story">When Marin arrived
at the chain link fence of the quarantine cages, Anwar, Daru, Wan, and Nolan
were staring ineptly at&#151;the word came to her and didn&#8217;t leave, like death itself&#151;<i>corpses</i>,
thirty orangutan corpses in cages one, two, three, four, and five: about a
fifth of the O/URC&#8217;s total population. The corpses of the young girls that she
and Will had shooed hurriedly into cages one and two the night before&#151;Gia,
Fatima, Thimbe, Gertie, Micah, Joanie, Deirdre, Sammy, Hedda, and Katja&#151;were
sprawled out with unaccountable limpness and smallness on the floors of the
first two cages, along with the corpses of seven older female apes, including
Bea, the orangutan they&#8217;d brought back for further rehabilitation after she&#8217;d
buckled herself into the pilot seat of the helicopter at release a few months
ago. Bea&#8217;s long, muscular corpse arms were drained of power. Renegade patches
of reddish hair were sticking up from the corpses. The thermogenic stink of
rotted vertebrate choked the air.</p>

<p class="Story">There were
balled-up pieces of plastic wrap in the floors of the cages. The O/URC did not
ever use plastic wrap. The back door to O.Q. was ajar, and Marin saw that
Anwar had the pieces of a sawed-open lock in his hands.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;You don&#8217;t think Jo-Jo&#133;&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If it was, I&#8217;ll
fucking kill him,&#148; Anwar said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nobody&#8217;s killing
anyone,&#148; Wan said. &#147;We&#8217;re moving the bodies to med, and Linda will do
autopsies so we can find out what happened here last night. Marin, can you go
look for Will? He&#8217;s not picking up his cellphone, and I need to speak with
him.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; Marin said,
already thinking about the best way to walk back to camp without running into
him. If she timed her text properly, and if he hadn&#8217;t already heard about the
O.Q. break-in from someone else, she could manage it.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan&#8217;s phone beeped,
and he clicked open a text message. &#147;Okay, no, here he is. He&#8217;s coming now,&#148;
Wan said. &#147;Okay, new job for you, Marin. Call <i>The Star </i>and <i>The New
Straits Times </i>to report this terrible tragedy. Tell them we&#8217;ve been fighting with
Indo-Oil over land in the rainforest.&#148;</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2004</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">C</span>harlie&#8217;s mother had gone to Portland to
spend Thanksgiving with her sister and her sister&#8217;s family, so Charlie had
invited Marin, Jorge, and Jorge&#8217;s law school friend Petra, a German woman with
large bags under her bright-blue eyes, over for a holiday dinner in the
downstairs apartment. Jorge, the unanimously designated executive chef for the
day, gushed covetously as soon as he saw Barbara&#8217;s gas-through-glass cooktop, 27K
BTU bridge burner, cast iron grill pan, and double 36-inch stainless steel
oven. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin, Charlie, and
Petra peeled, chopped, and diced the herbs and produce that Jorge and Petra had
hauled over from Berkeley Bowl. Charlie uncorked a bottle of two buck
chuck, and the sous chefs munched on pita and hummus and sipped red wine from
Barbara&#8217;s bowl-sized wine glasses as Jorge marinated and then roasted a lamb
shank; made mashed potatoes and gravy, chile relle&#241;os, and a pumpkin pie; and
crumbled blue cheese into mesclun greens and tossed in Petra-chopped walnuts,
Marin-chopped pears, olive oil, and balsamic.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie had grown
up in the three-floor Alamo Square Victorian. When his parents had gotten
divorced (many years ago), his mother Barbara had gotten the house and
primary custody of Charlie in the settlement. His father Jack had gotten to
marry his pregnant girlfriend and move to Los Altos. When Charlie left for
college in the mid-nineties, Barbara had immediately begun long-fantasized-about
renovations, converting the top (third) floor into a two-bedroom apartment with
its own kitchen and bathroom, and the bottom two floors into her dream home. A
partner of the San Francisco office of a national corporate accounting firm,
Barbara had excellent, expensive taste. Out had gone the chipped frosted glass
entertainment center and beige suede couches; in had come the sleek ironwood
coffee table, saffron chaise lounger, marble Ming end tables, and black silk
rug. The kitchen renovations alone had totaled $81,000. </p>

<p class="Story">Barbara&#8217;s dining
room table was covered with stacks of papers and other undisturbable Barbara
mess<b>, </b>so Charlie and his guests ate their Thanksgiving dinner on the
table in the kitchen, which was still much nicer than the eating areas of any
of their own apartments.</p>

<p class="Story">After they sat and
complimented the chef on the looks and smell of the feast in front of them,
Jorge carved pieces of lamb for everyone. They passed around the other dishes
and served themselves. Everything was delicious.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is why I love
dating girls with gay friends,&#148; Charlie said, holding out a piece of pink lamb
meat on his fork before popping it in his mouth.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin cringed&#151;not
just at Charlie&#8217;s insecurity and need to demasculinize Jorge&#8217;s cooking talents,
but his confidence that anyone would be anything but delighted by such crude
stereotyping. </p>

<p class="Story">Once, after an
awkward time with Charlie at a Kerry happy hour fundraiser, Marin had looked up
Asperger&#8217;s syndrome on the internet. As she&#8217;d read the description of the
disease, imprecise and full of loopholes though it had been, she&#8217;d known that
Charlie didn&#8217;t have Asperger&#8217;s. He was just kind of a douche bag.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Isn&#8217;t that all
girls nowadays, though?&#148; Jorge said, winking at Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How many other gay
men friends do you have, Petra?&#148; Charlie asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re kind of
friends with Vince, right?&#148; Jorge said. &#147;That&#8217;s my law school arch-enemy,&#148; he
informed Marin and Charlie.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Vince, like&#133;&#148;
Petra said. &#147;I think we are like friends professionally, like we will help
each other get interviews and contacts? But we&#8217;re not friends, friends. He&#8217;s
very intense into the law stuff sometimes, Vince.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, two, including
Jorge,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;And you, Miss Choo?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, god,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;It&#8217;s not like I keep a tally sheet at home or anything.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You should,&#148; Jorge
said, laughing. &#147;Between me and Garcia, you&#8217;ll already have two Mexi-gays, and
we&#8217;re the best kind. By the way, how is Mr. Garcia these days? I
haven&#8217;t talked to Benjamin since a few days after D&#237;a de los Muertos. And that
was only to ask me for the password to the PicView account that I set up for
everyone to upload their B. and J. wedding photos to.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin updated Jorge
on the Garcia situation. Mud23 had bumped its November show for a month-long
public exhibition of &#147;Gil Garcia: G x G.&#148; The sale of all seventeen works had
gone through last Friday, with Marin wiring the money to Mud23&#8217;s account, and
Phillip immediately drafting a check to Garcia for his cut. When the show
ended in a week, the paintings and sculpture would be stored temporarily at Mud23
while Ben and Phillip worked with Marianna Rioja to arrange a special auction
on December 20 at SFMoMA for everything but the two paintings that Marin
had decided to keep (<i>Unt&#237;tlede #2</i> and <i>Unt&#237;tlede #5</i>). Most
recently, based on a photograph of the altar sculpture on Mud23&#8217;s website, a
curator at the Whitney Museum in New York had placed an inquiry to Phillip
regarding inclusion of the sculpture in a spring exhibition at the Whitney
entitled &#147;American Faith.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And how&#8217;s Benjamin
holding up?&#148; Jorge asked. &#147;He sounded super, super tired when I talked to
him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin imagined that
Jorge still saw Ben as that charmed kid that floated effortlessly above it all
in college. She didn&#8217;t want to alarm Jorge, and didn&#8217;t feel that there was
anything to be alarmed about, but felt compelled to do some coded heavy
hinting.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, don&#8217;t feel
too bad for him. I always suspected Ben of being a secret Type A,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;I saw him about three times a week or more before the run up to
election day, and he seemed to love being triple-booked. Although I don&#8217;t
think that he was Mr. Familiar with BAARC&#8217;s little anti-contraception
coalition.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow. Do you think
that Judith was afraid that Ben would tell you, and that you&#8217;d tell your dad?&#148;
Jorge asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And ruin the only
meaningful Democratic victory this election?&#148; Charlie said. &#147;Even if Marin had
suddenly gone insane and decided to do that, I would have kept her distracted
with my manly wiles until election day.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I don&#8217;t really know Judith that well. I&#8217;m not sure she remembers
or cares what my dad does for a living, and even if she did, would she really
be afraid of a regional sales manager in Chicago?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s father had
unexpectedly gone to Hong Kong for ten days. His two brothers, Marin&#8217;s uncles, still lived there with their families and Marin&#8217;s
paternal grandparents. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Petra, so what do
you think of California politics?&#148; Charlie asked. &#147;Pretty nifty that we can
elect a barely-literate Austrian action movie star as governor, huh? Bet the
Germans are really glad they signed up for democracy now, huh?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The social dynamic
for the entire rest of the evening&#151;which included pie, after-dinner clean-up,
half-hearted channel surfing from positions terrible for one&#8217;s posture on and
in front of the saffron lounger, and an even more half-hearted perusal of
Barbara&#8217;s movie library&#151;was like this. Marin and Jorge would try to have a
conversation that they really should have waited until they were by themselves
to have, Charlie would interject with his unsolicited opinion or with a sudden
and terrible question to Petra that was worse than not trying to include her in
the conversation at all, and Petra would respond with a sincere and thoughtful
answer that made Marin cringe over Charlie all the more.</p>

<p class="Story">After Charlie and
Marin had said goodnight to Petra and Jorge, sending them back to the East Bay
with a heavy bag of leftovers, Charlie horrified Marin further by wanting to
have sex on his mother&#8217;s saffron lounger. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;First of all,&#148; Marin
listed her reasons for NO to his proposition of saffron lounger sex, &#147;I&#8217;m not
sure how opaque your mom&#8217;s curtains are down here. Secondly, that sofa looks
incredibly difficult to remove stains from. Thirdly, your apartment is
upstairs!&#148; <i>Fourthly</i>, Marin added silently, <i>you say terrible,
terrible things sometimes during conversations.</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, Miss Picky,
let&#8217;s go upstairs, then,&#148; Charlie said. He seemed to get that he&#8217;d been trying
her patience. &#147;There&#8217;s just something sexy about an empty house. I hardly
ever come down here. I sometimes forget that it looks completely different
from when I was a kid.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin waited for
him at the foot of Barbara&#8217;s stairs&#151;it was two less doors and four less locks
to deal with if they went to the second floor deck and walked up the outside
stairs to Charlie&#8217;s back entrance&#151;as Charlie turned off all of the first floor
lights. During the renovation, a quarter-inch of bad paint jobs had been
removed from the banister, revealing a sturdy dark oak, which Barbara had had sanded
and varnished. Its dark surface now reflected light like one of Marin&#8217;s occult
bookstore neighbor&#8217;s black-hearted orbs. The wall to the left of the stairs
had been painted olive green and photos of old, industrial San Francisco hung
on it in silver frames, ascending with the stairs. </p>

<p class="Story">Charlie was right:
there was something sexy about an empty house.</p>

<p class="Story">The living room
darkened, and Charlie came out from it and followed Marin up the stairs. </p>

<p class="Story">The power of
suggestion: when they reached the second floor, Charlie tried his luck again,
with 100% greater success, on Barbara&#8217;s Mondrian-patterned rug at the head of
the stairs. </p>

<p class="Story">Charlie brushed his
face in between Marin&#8217;s breasts afterward and smiled.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re right, this
was much more civilized than that orange couch,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
smiled, put the fingers of her right hand through his brown hair, and took a
deep breath of his apey oils.</p>

<p class="first">The next morning, on Black Friday, Pac and
the blogosphere were both closed, and Marin woke up under Charlie&#8217;s gray plaid duvet
on the right side of Charlie&#8217;s futon, smelling Charlie&#8217;s smells. Charlie
whistled <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> slowly and sweetly as he stroked Marin&#8217;s arm and
checked his emails on his mobile communication device. The small white room,
decorated only with framed <i>Tech </i>newspapers from Charlie&#8217;s year as
editor-in-chief, flooded with light through the blinds and skylight. </p>

<p class="Story">The previous night&#8217;s
awkwardness had been Marin&#8217;s fault possibly. Or no one&#8217;s fault: sometimes
conversations between like-minded, not-awkward people just got weird.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">A week later, Marin was certainly glad that
she&#8217;d not broken up with Charlie over a few off-color remarks, if only because
the Pac holiday party was suddenly upon her without warning (if one didn&#8217;t
count three email reminders, the original email teaser, and the official gray
cardstock invitation she&#8217;d received in the mail). Charlie, lovely man and
boyfriend that he was, had agreed a month ago to go with her and wear the
tuxedo that he owned and fit him perfectly.</p>

<p class="Story">If Jennifer
Olyphant had not been exaggerating two years ago, the annual Pac holiday party
was a black-tie Eurotrash rave with wonky policy discussions in the bathroom
instead of drugs. Although Marin was curious to experience this recombinant
social scene, she was not looking forward to socializing with her coworkers. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had now
worked on the sixth floor of Pac nearly twice as long as she&#8217;d worked on the
tenth floor. Last Wednesday, the potentially gratifying situation of Kendra
asking Marin for help with a regression analysis on a Laotian dataset took a
strange turn when Marin realized that the dataset was the results of a project
that she had signed off on two years ago as an RS. She hadn&#8217;t even realized it
until she&#8217;d seen the researcher&#8217;s email address (hailey.johnson@pac.org). </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had emailed
back and forth twenty times with Hailey Johnson in October and early November
of 2002, passing on to Hailey Ray&#8217;s edits to her proposal for a study of
education and literacy in the Laotian countryside. Since November 2002, Hailey
had had her proposal audited and approved by Budget and Standards, moved to
Laos, gathered data about classroom sizes, student-to-teacher ratios, student
retention rates, reading and math skills, and graduation rates in ninety-eight
Laotian villages, and formally interviewed eighty-nine teachers in rural Laos
as well as the country&#8217;s Minister of Education. Since November 2002, Marin had
screwed around in Borneo for fourteen months, screwed around in mainland Southeast
Asia for two months, worked in a windowless lab in downtown San Francisco for nine months, and
bought sixteen paintings and a mixed media sculpture from a manic-depressive
bicycle courier.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin knew that
such a paucity of serious accomplishments in comparison to Hailey Johnson should bother
her, but it didn&#8217;t. Disillusionment, Marin was discovering, ran in only one
direction. Two years ago, she&#8217;d bought Will&#8217;s withering indictment of Pac as a
gutless bureaucracy, and she bought it still, maybe more since her internment
in the sunless cave of joyless tapping. Becoming also disillusioned with
Will and the O/URC in the intervening years hadn&#8217;t reversed her initial
disillusionment with Pac.</p>

<p class="Story">Garcia was not
without flaws, but somehow the world seemed simpler after looking at his
paintings: they were so clearly good; it would be so clearly good for the world
to see them. Wiring that money away had been the easiest thing that Marin had
ever done. </p>

<p class="last">Marin
had gone to Mud23 two days after the sale, stood alone in the room of art that
was&#151;at that moment&#151;hers, and felt for the first time in a very long time like
an operational part of the world. </p>

<p class="first">The night of the holiday party, Marin
packed into the sixth-floor women&#8217;s bathroom with ten other DatInf girls and
changed into the green dress that she&#8217;d bought for the occasion. She then
hurried to Union Square to meet Charlie. Ugly gray clouds that looked like
cartoon smog filled the sky and promised imminent rain. As Marin walked up the
steps to the elevated plaza, flat, short blasts of wind slapped her hair up
into her chin and blew the hem of her trench coat back and forth in rapid jerks
like an injured bird desperately attempting flight.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie was
standing in the very center of the plaza. He&#8217;d shaved close and looked, for
the first time since Marin had met him, like Wall Street material. When he saw
her, he smiled with his lips only and very slightly. He reached into his
pocket, took out a silver dollar coin, tossed it in the air, caught it, and slapped
it into the back of his left hand just as Marin came close.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Heads or tails?&#148;
he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin covered his
covering hand with both of hers and closed her eyes, divining like a palm
reader. &#147;Tails,&#148; she said, opening her eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie lifted the
covering hands, revealing Lady Liberty in mid-stride, her right hand held out
to the rising sun.<b> </b>Charlie pocketed the coin silently and grabbed
Marin&#8217;s hand with both of his.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m actually
excited about this,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You bloggers,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Awkward coworker interaction is so full of fun novelty for you
lot.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A roomful of
people who know who Wassily Leontief is&#133; The question is not, <i>&#8216;Why am I so
excited about this?&#8217;</i> It&#8217;s, <i>&#8216;Why aren&#8217;t you more excited?&#8217;</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">And somehow, with
the doggy, dry warmth of Charlie&#8217;s hand in hers as they walked to the hotel
where the party was, Marin started to become excited. By the lobby entrance
was a foam board on an easel directing them to the twentieth floor. On the
twentieth floor, the ascending and descending bleeps of a trancecore hook
rippled over a complicated beat. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Charlie
checked in with the HR assistants at the tablecloth-covered table in the hall,
and they gave Marin and Charlie each a pink piece of paper with three columns
of blank lines and the following printed on it: <i>&#147;PAC HOLIDAY PUZZLE 2004
(Most correct answers wins two tickets to </i>Turandot<i>.) Name as many Asian
(NON-Oceania) cities as you can, typical current spellings, with one word names
(NO hyphenates), each exactly 5, 6, or 7 letters long.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">When Charlie
finished reading, he looked at Marin with an enormous, naughty smile on his
face.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know you have a
pen,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know you don&#8217;t
even like opera,&#148; Marin said. She reached in her handbag and fished out a
purple Respiatin pen.</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie took it
from her. &#147;You know, you should probably start saving these for eBay,&#148; he
said, indicating the pen.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Beijing, Mersing,
Kuching,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Wait,
wait, wait!&#148; he said. He clicked the pen open, folded his pink paper in
quarters, and wrote &#147;BEIJING&#148; in very neat block letters on the first line. &#147;Okay, spell the other two for me.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Inside the ballroom, strings of neon pink,
green, yellow, and orange lights hung from the ceiling in varying lengths. The
entire length of the far end of the room was filled with two long rows of
slatted wooden lounge chairs with Thai triangle Khit cushions on them. At the
other end, where Charlie and Marin had entered, a tall plywood pseudo-primitive
architectural construction snaked around in a stretched-out &#147;M&#148; shape. About
twenty silver-green hotel couches were arranged chaotically in its nooks. </p>

<p class="Story">Pac staffers in
formalwear sat in small groups on the furniture and stood in the middle of the
dance floor in small groups, and more than one couple was slow-dancing to the rabid
techno music. There were several women (South Asian, East Asian, and Caucasian)
in saris, but no men in any kind of ethnic dress. Nobody, it seemed, had
gotten their hair done for the occasion. Every once in a while, someone would
raise up a fist and open the fingers on it one-by-one, counting. They or their
dates would take out a folded pink piece of paper, write on it, fold it again,
and put it back.</p>

<p class="Story">The two bars on the
perimeter were small and busy. Marin and Charlie waited on the long, fast-moving
line of one of them, and ordered what every other heterosexual couple at the
party had ordered: champagne for her, whisky on the rocks for him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;OH MY GOD MARIN
YOU CAME!&#148; a very pregnant Jen Olyphant said. </p>

<p class="Story">A tall man with
curly light-brown hair and wearing the exact same tuxedo as Charlie was
standing beside Jen, carrying a glass of whisky on the rocks, a glass of ice,
and a bottle of mineral water. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is my husband
John,&#148; Jen said. &#147;John, this is our old RS, Marin, who works in DatInf now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Um</i>, okay,
how did I not know that you were <i>with child</i>?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I had a
miscarriage earlier this year,&#148; Jen said. &#147;So I was totally, totally paranoid
about telling people that I was pregnant. We basically didn&#8217;t tell anyone,
ever, and I literally just started showing two weeks ago.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Then, <i>blgghhhhtth!</i>&#148;
John said, cupping his hands together and moving them slowly apart. He
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You can ask Ray,
it really freaked him out,&#148; Jen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well,
congratulations. This is Charlie, by the way,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Charlie, this is
Jen and John.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How many cities
you guys got?&#148; John asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thirteen,&#148; Charlie
said. &#147;You?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sixteen,&#148; John
said. &#147;We&#8217;ve been here since six though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Vipool won last
year,&#148; Jen said. &#147;It was listing the top fifteen most populous countries in
Asia, in order of descending population.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We only got five
right on that one,&#148; John said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;China, India,
Indonesia&#133;&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh no, we&#8217;re not
doing last year&#8217;s game too,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">John laughed. &#147;It&#8217;ll torture you the rest of the night, sorry!&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, I was
actually thinking about calling you,&#148; Jen said. &#147;There&#8217;s a chance that I won&#8217;t
be coming back after my maternity leave ends. It depends on if John gets the
job that he wants in the Peninsula and if we find a house and about a thousand
other things, but <i>you should talk to Ray</i>. I haven&#8217;t told Vipool yet,
but probably will soon.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow, okay, yeah,&#148;
Marin said. She felt confused by Jen&#8217;s warmth and sorority. They had never
been particularly close when they had worked together, and only talked to each
other now if they ran into each other accidentally in the office. It was
nostalgia plus incidental pregnancy affection, Marin supposed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, better go
take my many pills now,&#148; Jen said. &#147;Bye Marin. Nice to meet you, Charlie.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie and Marin
walked into the middle of the dance floor together. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You lied about our
cities,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;All&#8217;s fair in love
and&#133; trivia contests,&#148; Charlie said. &#147;So are you going to take the pregnant
chick&#8217;s job?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That wouldn&#8217;t seem
particularly fair to Vipool,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Besides, I&#8217;m not sure if she was
offering me her job, or Vipool&#8217;s job, which is actually my old job, and none of
which she would be in any position to offer anyway.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Taipei!&#148; Charlie
said. He pulled out the pink sheet folded in his jacket pocket. &#147;How could we
forget the capital city of one of Asia&#8217;s brightest economies?&#148; he said as he
wrote &#147;TAIPEI&#148; on line 17 of the sheet.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin spotted
Kendra and Joon and two guys of exactly average height, weight, and attractiveness
walk onto the dance floor and form a cluster behind the group behind Charlie. Marin prepared appropriate compliments, grabbed Charlie by the elbow, and
walked over to her labmates.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey,&#148; she said. &#147;Have you guys met my other of significance Charlie before? Charlie, these are
my labmates Kendra and Joon.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The girls
introduced their guys. Kendra&#8217;s was named Greg, and Joon&#8217;s was named Chris.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I like your
necklace,&#148; Marin said to Kendra.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks, I hate
wearing jewelry,&#148; Kendra said. &#147;I can&#8217;t believe they let Drew Doolidge build
one of his retarded Burning Man sculptures again.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I liked the wells
he built last year,&#148; Chris said. &#147;It reminded me of my favorite movie of
all-time, <i>Daffy Duck&#8217;s Fantastic Island</i>. I just wish they&#8217;d put kegs
inside.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Chris and Greg were
both drinking what looked and smelled like vodka on the rocks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;As if you need
help building your beer gut,&#148; Joon said.</p>

<p class="Story">Chris put his arm
around her. &#147;You love my gut, don&#8217;t you, baby?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Joon wrinkled her
nose and shook her head, <i>no</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">Greg started
laughing and hit Chris on the shoulder. &#147;The part in <i>DDFI </i>when Daffy
wishes that the burrito gets stuck to Speedy&#8217;s nose?&#148; he said. &#147;So awesome.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The awesomest,&#148;
Chris said.</p>

<p class="Story">They clinked
glasses and drank. </p>

<p class="Story">Just when Marin had
thought that she&#8217;d met every kind of asshole that there was, new species
mutated into being before her eyes. She named the new
classic-cartoon-farce-appreciating, vodka-on-ice-drinking species &#147;Chreg&#148; after
Chris and Greg.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s a really
cute bag, Joon,&#148; Charlie said, startling Marin, as not only had she never told
Charlie anything about her labmates, but <i>&#147;That&#8217;s a really cute bag, Joon&#148;</i>
was also the very compliment, almost to the word, that she had prepared for
Joon ahead of time and had been about to make.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, this is old,&#148;
Joon said, looking as frightened of Charlie as if he&#8217;d just cursed at her. &#147;But thanks.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, did you
see Debbie Newhouse&#8217;s pink leather coat?&#148; Kendra said. &#147;I think she buys her
entire wardrobe in the Castro.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Debbie Newhouse was
the DatInf woman who managed the physical archive. She&#8217;d worked at Pac for
fifteen years, nearly her whole professional life.</p>

<p class="Story">Someone tapped
Marin on her shoulder. It was her replacement, Vipool.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin Choo,&#148; he
said. </p>

<p class="Story">He had with him a
beautiful, tall, bored-looking South Asian woman wearing a strapless
bronze-colored dress and was himself wearing a very nice tux.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Vipool Parashar,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is my
girlfriend Radhika,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin introduced
Charlie.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re the man to
beat on the pink sheets, I hear,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin saw Joon,
Kendra, and the Chregs head back out into the hall together. She saw Ray enter
with Pac&#8217;s executive director Stellan Ralskjold through the same doorway.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I just have a
preoccupation with populousness that helped me in that particular instance,&#148;
Vipool said. &#147;So Olyphant&#8217;s leaving to become a Silicon Valley soccer mom.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t think
that Jen had lied to her when she&#8217;d said she hadn&#8217;t told Vipool about her
resignation plans yet; Vipool was obviously just one of those supernaturally
involved people who know all of the office gossip first and accurately.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I heard,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;But it&#8217;s not definite, right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Olyphant has <i>lost
her mind</i>. She wants five babies. She&#8217;s pretty much going to start trying
to get pregnant again after she pops this one out. I&#8217;m taking over as
Southeast Asia RA, although Ray knows that I do want to get back to the Central
Asia side of things eventually. There&#8217;s a guy in Ralskjold&#8217;s office who&#8217;s
angling for Southeast Asia RS, but Ray really wants you to come back. There&#8217;s
some maneuvering that will be involved, though, because someone who had no idea
what he was talking about promised the other guy the next open RS position when
he almost left Pac last summer for a shitty research job at Brookings.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had a
tangible feeling of not wanting to play the game. She was like the superhero
in the movie who has lost his powers and tries to zap an encroaching enemy only
to find himself zapless. She tried to be practical. She tried to be sensible. She tried to care about increasing the income and educational levels of the
working poor in Asia, about finding and funding the small projects that work,
about fostering long-term, sustainable growth and change. She tried to be the
person that she used to be. But she was zapless.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That sounds really
complicated,&#148; Charlie said. </p>

<p class="Story">Vipool laughed
self-consciously, aware that he&#8217;d appeared to be enjoying the unserious aspects
of his job too much. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Anyway, I was
counting on Marin to start popping my babies out soon, so,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">Radhika roared with
laughter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s joking,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, too
funny,&#148; Radhika said, wiping tears from her eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">Vipool shrugged as
if to say, <i>what do I know?</i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t see
why Charlie&#8217;s comment had been so funny to Radhika, but Marin was happy and
proud that she had the less self-serious boyfriend.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Anyway, talk to
Ray if you&#8217;re interested,&#148; Vipool said. &#147;Good to see you, Marin.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He and Radhika
left.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin turned to
Charlie and smoothed the collar of his jacket. &#147;Are you funny?&#148; she asked him,
cocking an eyebrow.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m just a smart
ass,&#148; he said, rolling his eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">She kissed him,
sought out the fishy wetness of his tongue. <i>Zap, zap, zap-zap-zap.</i></p>

<p class="Story">They disconnected,
and Marin slipped her hand into his jacket pocket and pulled out the folded
pink sheet. She handed it to him and said, &#147;Suzhou, Chengdu, Tianjin, Wuhan.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You are one
complicated woman, Marin Choo,&#148; Charlie said, unfolding and refolding the paper
to the next block of blank lines and taking the pen out.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I sold some stocks,&#148;
he said. &#147;I&#8217;m thinking of bidding at the auction.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The Garcia
auction?&#148; Marin said. &#147;My auction?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Charlie
said. &#147;It&#8217;s going to be huge. I might not be able to afford anything. I am,
however, going to have a very rich girlfriend.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, don&#8217;t jinx
me,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, I take it
all back. Now, city me up,&#148; he said, clicking the pen open.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">At five-thirty on December 20, Marin once
again went into Pac&#8217;s sixth-floor bathroom to change into her green dress, but
she had her pick of stalls this time. She went into the first stall and hung
her dress hanger on the hook on the inside of the door. She removed her work
clothes and unzipped the green dress. She stepped into its center and pulled
its thin straps over her shoulders. The thin silk and metal zipper were cold
against her skin. Someone came into the bathroom, went into the stall next to
Marin&#8217;s, and peed noisily. </p>

<p class="Story">Garcia had quit his
messenger job and gone to Mexico for a few weeks to think and paint. The only
familiar faces for Marin at the auction tonight would be those of Charlie, Ben,
Judith, Phillip, and the other Mud23 staffers. Marin was beginning to
understand why Garcia had freaked out at the D&#237;a de los Muertos party. Over
the past few weeks, she had been advised informally on the auction process by
Ben, by Phillip, and by SFMoMA&#8217;s auction director, but Marin couldn&#8217;t make her
jitters go away.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
didn&#8217;t understand why she was nervous tonight, when there was nothing for her
to do, when tonight&#8217;s outcome was essentially a foregone conclusion, and when,
one month ago, she hadn&#8217;t been nervous at all before, during, or after the
signing of the twenty-two-page purchasing agreement and the wiping out of two
whole digits from the balance of her bank account. </p>

<p class="first">Ben was waiting for Marin in the museum lobby
as planned. Wearing a dark orange sweater over a striped shirt and gray wool
pants, he looked good. He was talking to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#146;s gorgeous, glamorous director Marianna Rioja, and it looked like <i>he</i>
was instructing <i>her</i> on some matter. The day&#8217;s last herds of tourists
milled around uncertainly, looking at their glossy museum maps.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin waved to Ben,
and he saw her. Marianna left, and Ben walked over to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey, how are you
feeling?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Unexpectedly
nervous,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben started walking
her into the lobby. He opened a door labeled <i>&#147;Staff Only&#148;</i> and led Marin
down an empty corridor. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s going to be
very fast,&#148; Ben said. &#147;The only thing we&#8217;re not sure about is the sculpture,
but the paintings alone should go for over a million altogether.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s crazy,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">They stopped in
front of an elevator, and Ben pressed the up button.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s very, very,
very good,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Mud23&#8217;s cut will be 40%, as usual. SFMoMA&#8217;s fees will
come out of our cut. Charlie&#8217;s upstairs waiting for you. I like him. He&#8217;s
really funny.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s just a smart
ass,&#148; Marin said, but she smiled, remembering how deftly he&#8217;d handled her Pac
coworkers at the holiday party.</p>

<p class="Story">The elevator doors
opened, and Marin walked into its silver box.</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin:0"><b>GARCIA AUCTION GENERATES HEAT</b></p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">BY HONOR H. LEWIS,
NEWS EDITOR</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin:0">On
December 20, 2004, SFMoMA hosted an auction for the sale of 15 new works
by Mission-born and -raised artist Gilbert Xavier Garcia. &#147;Who?&#148; you might be
asking, and rightly so. Garcia burst onto the San Francisco art scene only
last November, with a solo show at Mud23 Gallery that included the auctioned
works and 2 other paintings. Garcia is a prot&#233;g&#233; of renowned street artist and
painter Rocco Morris, and Garcia&#8217;s work vividly fuses traditional Chicano/a elements
with painfully realistic renderings of the pills and bottles that hold the
drugs that are literally the key to his future, as Garcia is HIV-positive. The
14 paintings sold for $70,000 to $200,000 each. The final lot of the evening
was a 5&#8217;-tall wax sculpture in the shape of a D&#237;a de los Muertos altar. It
sold for $210,000, bringing the evening&#8217;s gross to nearly $2 million.</p>

</div>

<p class="first">Marin gave two weeks&#8217; notice at Pac. She
cancelled her Christmas trip home to Chicago to work through the holiday and
finish all of her active projects by January 4. She actually enjoyed the
work&#151;it seemed like a much-needed penance for the immense sums of money being
deposited in her bank account. At five o&#8217;clock on Monday, January 4, Charlie,
who&#8217;d dutifully rented movies and bought and baked frozen pizza for their
low-key New Year&#8217;s Eve, waited for Marin down the street from Pac&#8217;s building in
his father&#8217;s Volkswagon Cabriolet, which they were taking to Carmel for the
week.</p>

<p class="Story">They took 280, and
the freeway&#8217;s vista of western junipers, black wattle acacia, and horse-tail
beefwoods seemed as fresh and Californian as it had on Marin&#8217;s first drive
through this stretch of the Pacific coast as an admit weekend pre-frosh seven
years ago.</p>

<p class="Story">As they drove past
Stanford and the Foothills, Marin&#8217;s phone rang&#151;it was her father. She picked
up.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello?&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, I got your
Christmas present today, thank you,&#148; Walter said. He sounded upbeat, back to
his old self after several weeks of sounding distracted every time that Marin
called. &#147;I needed a new doorstop, ha-ha.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had gotten
him a copy of <i>The Power Broker</i>, the one-thousand-page biography of
former New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you at work?&#148;
Walter asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; Marin said. &#147;The reason why I was too busy to come home for Christmas was because today was
actually my last day.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What? You quit
again?&#148; he asked. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m thinking of
going back to school,&#148; Marin said. She didn&#8217;t know why she hadn&#8217;t told her
father anything about Garcia. She didn&#8217;t know why successfully navigating the
entire thing and coming out $1 million ahead hadn&#8217;t made it easier to tell him
now.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m coming to San
Francisco in a few weeks to talk to an old rep about some things,&#148; he said. &#147;We&#8217;ll discuss this then.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">And he hung up.</p>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he Airport Express doors opened onto
a quiet and empty train platform with clean, glossy floors. Walter wheeled his
bag out to the exit gates, where he saw his younger brother Emmanuel and
Emmanuel&#8217;s youngest daughter April, now fifteen, waiting for him on the other
side. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Oldest Brother,&#148; </i>Emmanuel said in

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;No, at the airport
I ate congee</i>,&#148;
Walter said. He hugged Emmanuel and patted April on the shoulder. <i>&#147;How are
you, April? How&#8217;s school?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Okay,&#148; </i>April said. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Where are Mom and
Dad?&#148; </i>Walter
asked Emmanuel.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;They&#8217;re at home
with Bree,&#148;</i> Emmanuel
said, referring to his wife. <i>&#147;Since you ate already, let&#8217;s just go home and
rest, and then we can all meet Troy and Cherie at noon for dim sum.&#148; </i>Troy
was Walter&#8217;s youngest brother, and Cherie was Troy&#8217;s wife. They had a son and
a daughter, Thomas and Ada, aged fifteen and thirteen, respectively. Emmanuel
had two other daughters, Emily, twenty, a student at Cambridge, and Allie,
seventeen.</p>

<p class="Story">Emmanuel took the
handle of Walter&#8217;s bag from him and wheeled it outside and to the taxi stand. A red cab pulled up, and Emmanuel opened the trunk and put Walter&#8217;s bag
inside. April got into the back seat and sat in the middle. She took out her
phone, a pink razor, and started texting in Chinese. Her father went around to
the far side, and Walter went in after April and closed the door. Emmanuel gave the taxi driver his address in Cantonese, and then switched to
English.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is everything okay
at your company right now?&#148; Emmanuel said. &#147;All of our pharmaceutical clients are
restructuring their sales and marketing operations. It&#8217;s good news for our
life sciences division, a lot of interest in emerging markets from the big
players now, but I guess that comes at the expense of somewhere else in the
budget.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Emmanuel was a
management consultant with an international firm. He wasn&#8217;t stupid. He&#8217;d put
two and two together. Walter suddenly buying a ticket to Hong Kong after what
had happened on November 2? However, no way was he telling his younger brother
(six years Walter&#8217;s junior due to two miscarriages in between) that on the
Friday after election day, Walter had been called into 220 South Wacker by Jack
Jaffrey and Felicia Wright, Fenniskrante&#8217;s (black) senior vice president of
Human Resources, and been &#147;offered&#148; an early retirement package.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, it&#8217;s just a
lot of to-do about nothing,&#148; Walter said. &#147;It happens every six years or so. It happened at the beginning of the internet boom, and when the first big TV
ads went on air. Everyone always goes into a panic&#151;<i>&#8216;It&#8217;s the end! We&#8217;re
obsolete!&#8217;</i> All of that Arthur Miller b.s.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Emmanuel nodded and
sat back in his seat.</p>

<p class="last">Walter
looked outside the cab window. They were stalled at a traffic light in
Central, Hong Kong&#8217;s central business district. Plainly coiffed Chinese people
in business attire waited at bus stops in front of ads for French perfume and
Italian handbags. It was bright and sunny, seventy degrees Fahrenheit
according to the flight attendant who&#8217;d announced their arrival that morning. If Walter took Fenniskrante&#8217;s early retirement package, which included a
healthy pension and lifetime health insurance coverage, he could move back here
and get a one-bedroom apartment on the same road as his parents and brothers. No more Chicago winters; no more shoveling a driveway caked in ice. The
thought, for some reason, made Walter want to cry.</p>

<p class="first">Although Troy was a trader at J.P. Morgan
and therefore even more well-off than the solidly upper-middle-class Emmanuel
(Emmanuel&#8217;s wife Bree was an executive recruiter and Troy&#8217;s wife Cherie was a
corporate lawyer, so they cancelled each other out), Walter&#8217;s parents, Orson
and Patricia Choo, lived with Emmanuel&#8217;s family, presumably because Bree was a
better homemaker than the notorious rice burner Cherie. </p>

<p class="Story">Emmanuel&#8217;s
apartment was a two-thousand-square-feet four-bedroom, large by Hong Kong
standards. The living room was quiet and empty when Emmanuel opened the door
and waited for Walter to go inside before following him with Walter&#8217;s
suitcase. April quickly took off her shoes and hurried into her room. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;You&#8217;ll sleep in
Emily&#8217;s room,&#148; </i>Emmanuel
said. </p>

<p class="Story">He walked Walter
down the hall, past the bedroom where April was sitting at her desk with her
knees pulled up to her chest and playing chess on her computer. Emmanuel
pushed open the next door on the left, and put Walter&#8217;s bag inside. It
appeared, not surprisingly, that despite the room&#8217;s official possession by the
away-at-college Emily, Emmanuel&#8217;s middle daughter, Allie, had been using the
room in her absence. The top of the dresser was filled with teenage girl
cosmetics&#151;dessert-flavored lip gloss, glittery nail polish, pop star brand
perfume&#151;and tiny photo stickers on the baby-blue plastic frame of an oval
mirror on the wall showed Allie with two girl friends making silly faces. </p>

<p class="Story">The first round of
difficulties with Marin had caught both Walter and Jinny off guard: Marin had
still been an adolescent, only fourteen when she&#8217;d begun sneaking out to rock
clubs in Chicago. Only a year before, a typical Friday night had been a Disney
movie and a chaste sleepover with two or three girl friends. Seeing how the
innocence of Walter&#8217;s brother&#8217;s daughters had continued, uncomplicated, well
beyond fourteen, Walter felt newly cheated out of his own innocence as a
parent, felt newly justified in his anger at a universe that would not only rob
him simultaneously of his wife and his daughter, but do so far more early than
was fair. </p>

<p class="Story">And now, during one
of the most politically conservative stretches of modern American history, when
Republicans everywhere were gleefully checking items off protracted to-do lists
scribbled down bitterly during those wasteful, shameful Clinton years, a bunch
of smarmy liberal operators had somehow worked the system&#151;<i>Walter&#8217;s</i> system, the
system-lover&#8217;s system, not theirs&#151;to rob him early of his career.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Mom! Dad!&#148; </i>Emmanuel shouted in
Chinese. <i>&#147;</i>Walter&#8217;s<i> here!</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">There was some
shuffling of house slippers, Emmanuel moved aside, and the pink and white faces
of Walter&#8217;s parents peeked into the bedroom. One look at their faces, still
the most familiar in the world to him, and Walter was immediately reunited with
that version of himself that was a son, not a father/widower/manager. This
moment of reorientation was as bracing as physically turning around 180 degrees
in a single step.</p>

<p class="Story">As Orson and
Patricia came into the room and embraced Walter happily, he could see that the
transformation that had begun with his parents&#8217; slow move into the middle class
during the 1970s, and accelerated upon Walter&#8217;s father&#8217;s retirement and the
onset of Walter&#8217;s mother&#8217;s menopause, was now complete. Gone was the spoiled
daughter of a Sichuan official, who&#8217;d resented her lower-class husband for the
loss of status and material comforts she&#8217;d suffered upon marrying him, and
who&#8217;d spent endless hours maliciously picking apart the more fortuitous
circumstances of those of her former classmates who&#8217;d also come to Hong Kong. In her place was a doting grandmother whose wicked sense of humor was used only
to diffuse, never to create, tension. Gone was the self-loathing and
thin-skinned shipping supervisor who&#8217;d buckled under pressure. In his place
was a sunny-eyed dispenser of practical wisdom and dedicated cultivator of chi.</p>

<p class="Story">Orson held his hands
palms side out in front of Walter&#8217;s face. <i>&#147;Do you feel that?&#148; </i>Orson
asked in Cantonese. He grabbed his own wrist, his own forearm, his own tricep,
his own side, and then swept over this progression of body parts again with a
slow, elegant motion of his hand. <i>&#147;A river of energy.&#148; </i>He made a fist
with his other hand.<i> &#147;Strong, like the Yangtze.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s mother
rolled her eyes. <i>&#147;The Yangtze doesn&#8217;t have to urinate every twenty
minutes,&#148; </i>she said.</p>

<p class="Story">Emmanuel laughed
and looked at his watch. &#147;Let&#8217;s leave for dim sum at eleven-thirty, okay?&#148; he
said, tapping the face of his watch with the nail of his index finger and
leaving the obsolete old people to talk amongst themselves.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s parents
sat down next to each other on Emily/Allie&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;How&#8217;s work?&#148; </i>Walter&#8217;s father
asked. <i>&#147;Still enjoying your responsibilities? Enjoy it while you can. Before you know it, your daughter will be taking care of you.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Orson raised his
eyebrows to indicate what he thought about Emmanuel&#8217;s show of authority.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin&#133;&#148; Walter&#8217;s
mother said. <i>&#147;Does your pretty girl have a new boyfriend yet?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes, but I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s too serious,&#148; </i>Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;White guy, again?&#148;
</i>Patricia
asked.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Yes,&#148; </i>Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Someone from
work?&#148; </i>Patricia
asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter realized
that he didn&#8217;t know how Marin and Charlie knew each other. He shook his head, <i>No</i>. &#147;Friend of a friend,&#148; he said in English.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Not too serious is
okay,&#148; </i>Orson
said. <i>&#147;Become more mature first, before getting married. It&#8217;s better.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Orson put his arm
around Patricia, as if their current state of peace and genial banter were
proof positive of this advice. In reality, they had married at nineteen in the
chaos of 1947 and spent the next two decades inflicting every kind of
unrealistic expectation and passive-aggressive hurt on each other that they
could think of. </p>

<p class="Story">Still, Walter&#8217;s
parents did make retirement look good. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>If Jinny was still
alive</i>&#151;and this was exactly the thought cul-de-sac Walter had been avoiding
since his meeting with Jack Jaffrey and Felicia Wright. Since Walter had
landed in Hong Kong it had started creeping up on him steadily, and he let
himself drive into its seductive hollows now. <i>If Jinny was still alive
she&#8217;d have found a way to make it work</i>. She would have known exactly what
questions to ask Jack and Felicia to knock them down a few notches from their
heavily-defended vantage of imperious compassion and get Walter the proverbial
offer-he-couldn&#8217;t-refuse. She would have ranted and raved on his behalf the
way it was impossible for him to do himself without sounding like a jerk. And
finally, she&#8217;d have remembered all of the activities and topics that he&#8217;d
showed interest in over the years but never picked up seriously due to lack of
time. As it was, he&#8217;d forgotten. He couldn&#8217;t think of a single thing that he
would rather do with the next eleven years of his life besides work. </p>

<p class="Story">And wasn&#8217;t that
hilarious? Wasn&#8217;t that a fucking riot? Wasn&#8217;t that just the most pathetic
thing you&#8217;ve ever heard? If Walter&#8217;s chi was ricocheting around inharmoniously
right now, Walter&#8217;s parents did not do him the discourtesy of noticing. They
were now discussing the best way for the six of them (Emmanuel, Bree, April,
Walter, Orson, and Patricia) to get to the dim sum restaurant. </p>

<p class="last">Some
kind of emotional jetlag was at work here. Night had fallen where Walter had
come from, but in Hong Kong everyone seemed certain of the bright workings of
their day.</p>

<p class="first">On his third night in Hong Kong, Walter
started dreaming in Cantonese. His thought patterns rearranged themselves into
the dense syllables and crude grammar constructions of the language of his
youth. In a dark room, a woman was telling him about himself. <i>You in Hong
Kong grew up. You three sons oldest. You twenty years old go America. You go
University of Chicago study books. Your wife forty-five years old die cancer. Your daughter go Stanford University study books. </i>Then she launched into a
series of exclamations that weren&#8217;t angry, but very loud and emphatic and
distressing all the same. <i>You left Hong Kong! You not can come back! You
not understand Hong Kong people! You not even understand your own mother,
father, brothers! You not can come back! You want go America? You in America
live! You in America die! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!</i></p>

<p class="last">There
were at least seven standalone <i>die</i>&#8217;s before Walter woke up in his little
girl&#8217;s bed, sunlight backlighting and streaming in through low-threadcount
cotton curtains. <i>Seih-la</i>, or &#147;die, exclamation word,&#148; was, in fact, a
relatively mild swear word in Cantonese, the equivalent of &#147;oh, shit&#148; in
contemporary colloquial English. Still, Walter needed a long, hot shower and a
big cup of coffee to feel like himself again after waking up from that.</p>

<p class="first">The rest of the week Walter fell into a
mindless, repetitive lull of eating, mah-jongg, and transit. He obsessively
replayed key phrases from the Jack Jaffrey-Felicia Wright meeting in his head
as he followed one or more of his brothers, their wives, or his parents through
Hong Kong&#8217;s morbidly crowded, exhaust-fogged streets and clean, incident-less
subway system to this noodle shop and that afternoon tea place and pushed cold
marble mah-jongg tiles around the table between hands (Jack Jaffrey: <i>&#147;You&#8217;re
everything a regional sales manager is supposed to be;&#148; </i>Felicia Wright: <i>&#147;On
a personal level, the thought of you leaving the fold is obviously very
devastating for us;&#148;</i> Felicia Wright: <i>&#147;I think you&#8217;ll find the terms
quite generous and in keeping with the quality of your contributions over the
years;&#148;</i> and Walter&#8217;s favorite, Jack Jaffrey: <i>&#147;The final curtain call is
always tough, really tough.&#148;</i>) Each night, Walter had another intense and
disturbing dream that left him feeling like someone had reached into his skull
in the middle of the night and wrung his brain out like a wet rag.</p>

<p class="last">The
election, the Dipentra launch, the D.A.R.E. bills, Stu Carroll and his number
one ranking, Eric Mulrhony and his cologne&#133; from Walter&#8217;s current vantage
point, far outside the original context, all of the events that had led to the
Jack Jaffrey-Felicia Wright meeting seemed like a season of a bad American
sitcom. Embarrassing and populated by lots of loud Caucasians of inexplicable
motivation, Walter wanted nothing to do with any of it these days. Easier to
be what he looked like here&#151;another Hong Kong Chinese in the crowd, shopping
and eating, eating and shopping&#151;and not let it get any more complicated than
that.</p>

<p class="first">The day before Walter&#8217;s flight back to
Chicago, he met his youngest brother Troy, the bonds trader, in the lobby of
Troy&#8217;s (slightly better and newer than Emmanuel&#8217;s) apartment building for an
early morning hike up Victoria Peak. Troy, at six-foot-one, was the tallest of
the Choo boys and the best-looking (although Emmanuel had been more confident
with, interested in, and successful with the opposite sex in high school and
college). Troy was wearing a baby blue T-shirt, dark-gray sweatpants,
blue-and-orange tennis shoes, and some kind of elastic bracelet. </p>

<p class="Story">Forty-six years
old, thick black hair curled luxuriantly over the youngest Choo boy&#8217;s brow. When he smiled, quotation marks appeared around the outer corners of his eyes,
which said: <i>underneath this pretty and accomplished exterior, I&#8217;m a soul in
search of meaning. </i>All of which meant that if Troy&#8217;s wife Cherie hadn&#8217;t
been who she was (among other things, the fiercest litigator in
Korplus-Wallem&#8217;s Hong Kong arsenal), many a J.P. Morgan junior associate would
have been more than happy to play the May to Troy&#8217;s December any month of the
year.</p>

<p class="Story">The weather was
perfect for the ninth day in a row. Walter and Troy hiked along a narrow
concrete path flanked by local botanicals&#151;amaranth, bamboo, calendula&#151;and to
the right they could see the dense skyscraper forest of Hong Kong, the
world-class city that had been slapped onto the side of a barren piece of rock
with <i>effort, </i>Walter thought, not charm.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I find that if I
don&#8217;t take this hike every morning, I get very, very angry at work,&#148; Troy said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really? Why?&#148; Walter was shocked. He&#8217;d never seen his youngest brother lose his temper.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We keep bringing
over all of these twenty-two-year-old Americans and Brits,&#148; Troy said, &#147;and for
the first three weeks they&#8217;re eager to learn, they ask lots of questions,
they&#8217;re scared of screwing up, but then, after they make a little bit of money,
all of a sudden they think they know everything there is to know about currency
and debt strategy and emerging markets. There is absolutely no respect for
senior people who have been doing this much longer, and no respect for the big
picture.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">It should have made
Walter feel better to hear his suave, wildly successful brother, one generation
Walter&#8217;s junior, voice the same frustrations that Walter had been having with
his own profession, but it just annoyed him. <i>Of course </i>Troy&#8217;s young
expat coworkers were like that. Why waste time sucking up to some cranky old
Chinese guy when the system was fixed in your favor? If the market crashed
again, it wouldn&#8217;t be the young gweilo Ivy Leaguers getting the boot. It would
be the cranky old Chinese guy. </p>

<p class="Story">Sometimes Walter
envied his brothers the unhyphenated sanctity of their existence as Asians
living in Asia. However, Walter&#8217;s day-to-day reality was more honest. As long
as America was the world&#8217;s largest economy, the Choos, no matter where they
lived, were second-class citizens in that world.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So just cash out,&#148;
Walter said, &#147;I&#8217;m sure the kids&#8217; college funds have plenty in them already, and
Cherie makes good money. You can stay home and cook. Do tai chi with Dad.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Troy laughed. &#147;I
think I&#8217;ll try to <i>endure</i> until Ada&#8217;s in college. That&#8217;s only five more
years, believe it or not.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">They hiked
single-file, Walter behind his brother, and talked about Allie&#8217;s college
prospects, Marin&#8217;s job and boyfriend, Senator Obama, the real estate market in
China, Troy and Cherie&#8217;s recent vacation in Sydney, and Orson&#8217;s and Patricia&#8217;s
health.</p>

<p class="Story">They reached the
roofed lookout point where they&#8217;d rest for a few minutes before turning back. They were on the south, sparsely-populated side of Hong Kong island. Sequins
of morning light rippled off the cerulean-black waters of the South China Sea
far below. A tiny red fishing boat idled along the shore. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter placed his
hands on one of the columns holding up the roof and stepped his legs back one
by one to stretch his calves. His body still felt capable and strong, far from
needing retiring.</p>

<p class="last">Troy
put his hands on the back of his own head with his elbows sticking straight out
like Dumbo ears. &#147;Time to make some money,&#148; he said, grinning madly.</p>

<p class="first">Three hours later, Walter went to Causeway
Bay alone to look for a Christmas present for Marin. The large mall called
Times Square grouped similar shop types by floor. Walter took a tall escalator
to the main lobby of the mall. He took an elevator to the electronics floor
and went into the largest shop. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;NEW NEW NEW,&#148; </i>a sign above a case
of cellphones said, <i>&#147;Unlimited Text-Call-EMail-VMail!! Easy HI-Speed
Music-MP3 Download!! State-of-ART Touch-Wipe-Go&#153; Technology!! Starting
HK$988!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Stu Carroll had a
Touch-Wipe-Go&#153; phone that he was obsessed with. When he&#8217;d shown off the
touchscreen technology to Walter in the field one day, Walter had joked that
&#147;Touch-Wipe-Go&#148; made him think of wiping after a shit. Stu had not found that
funny.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s whole trip
had been off. It had been a mistake to come to Hong Kong. Walter would have
probably been better off having Thanksgiving dinner with Marisol and her family
and then getting a cheap flight somewhere relatively warm&#151;Memphis or
Atlanta&#151;and wandering around a strange city for a few days. However, if he
could do this one thing, if Walter could just buy something, the right thing, a
thing radiating newness, progress, and sophisticated yet economical utility with
every chip and byte of its being, then he could hang onto that purchase like a
life raft, and that life raft would drift him back to the smooth-sailing cruise
ship of himself that he&#8217;d jumped from during the Jaffrey-Wright meeting in
Chicago two weeks ago.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter walked to
the wall to the right of the cellphones and picked up a hand-held video game
device. He moved the cursor over the &#147;New Game&#148; button and pressed ENTER. An
animated title slapped, letter by letter (gunshot sound effects punctuating the
arrival of each), onto the screen: &#147;ESCAPE FROM SLUM CITY.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Then, a startlingly
realistic animated image of a third world South American slum appeared. Latin-influenced dance music played as babies cried and a staticky radio
proclaimed the government corrupt and the fate of Slum City uncertain. Walter
pressed a button, and the machine gun whose barrel peeked out from the bottom
of the screen emptied bullets onto a palm tree while the device vibrated
violently, surprising and frightening Walter so much that he almost dropped it.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter put Slum
City down and picked up an LCD screen the size of a photograph frame. It
displayed the time in the upper-left-hand corner and a 3D animation of an
hourglass emptying itself.</p>

<p class="Story">A very skinny sales
assistant named, according to his name tag, &#147;Pike,&#148; came up to Walter. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Turn it over,&#148; </i>Pike said in
Cantonese.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter turned the
device face-down and felt incredibly stupid looking at its ventilated back.</p>

<p class="Story">Pike laughed. <i>&#147;No,
rotate it,&#148; </i>he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter gave the
thing to him, and Pike faced the screen towards Walter and then rotated it 180
degrees. The clock rotated in its place, righting itself to the new
orientation, and the hourglass also rotated in its place. The sand that had
accumulated in the bottom of the hourglass now spilled out from the top.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;You can adjust the
time here,&#148; </i>Pike
said, indicating some small buttons on the side of the screen. <i>&#147;And you can
change the hourglass from thirty seconds to one minute to fifteen minutes to
thirty minutes to one hour. And this button empties the sand.&#148; </i>Pike
pressed the last button and the sand&#8217;s spilling sped up, emptying the top into
the bottom in a few seconds.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter shook his
head, <i>no</i>. <i>&#147;I&#8217;m buying a present for my twenty-four-year-old
daughter,&#148; </i>he said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;What does she do? What does she like?&#148; </i>Pike
asked. <i>&#147;Music? Movies? Games?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter said, <i>&#147;She
works in data analysis. Do you have anything for sleep?&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Have, have, have,&#148;
</i>Pike
said. He walked Walter into the back of the store, alongside a
sixteen-foot-long counter filled end-to-end with beautiful platinum-cased
laptops with large high-resolution screens that flashed with animated pixel
rainbows, fireworks, shooting stars.</p>

<p class="Story">Pike picked up a
plastic white hamburger-shaped device. It was called &#147;SONAPSE SWEETSLEEP 3000&#148;
and was HK$1,888 (approximately $240).</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;This one is very
good for sleep,&#148; </i>Pike
said. <i>&#147;It uses a mix of active noise-canceling technology, </i>sonic-therapy<i>
music and nature sounds, and </i>humidity-normalization<i> to create the ideal
sleep environment. You just switch it on here thirty minutes before going to
bed.&#148; </i>Pike pressed a white button that then glowed white. <i>&#147;They did
research using the </i>SONAPSE SWEETSLEEP 3000<i> with chronic insomniacs in </i>Tokyo,
Helsinki<i>, and </i>Los Angeles<i>, and the </i>SONAPSE SWEETSLEEP 3000<i> was
80% more effective at increasing both quantity and quality of sleep than a </i>placebo<i>
pill and 15% more effective than the leading sleep-aid medication. It comes
pre-programmed with thirty environmental combinations so that you can recreate
anywhere in the world the sleeping environment that your ancestors evolved in.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">It was an
impressive detail presentation. Fenniskrante quality.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Your daughter is
Chinese?&#148; </i>Pike
asked.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Chinese, yes,&#148; </i>Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Okay,&#148; </i>Pike said, and he
turned the device around in his hand. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter couldn&#8217;t see
any other buttons on it besides the glowing power button. Pike pressed his
palm down on the top hamburger bun, and the bun lifted up slowly on a
spring-hinge. There was a small white button on a circular track inside. Pike
slowly pushed the button around the track clockwise and on the bottom face of
the top hamburger bun white letters glowed in and out, spelling a series of
abbreviated place names: SCAND-A, E-EUR/BALK, W-EUR/UK, MEDITER-N, INDIA, and,
finally, CHINA. Pike then pressed down gently on the button and then closed
the top hamburger bun with a small snap. </p>

<p class="Story">Tiny holes in the
perimeter of the hamburger patty started to emit a thin stream of sugary steam,
choking Walter. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;That&#8217;s why you
have to turn it on one half-hour before going to bed,&#148; </i>Pike said. <i>&#147;The
steam turns off after </i>normalization<i>.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter took a step
away from it, nodded, and coughed sweet steam into his fist. Then, Walter
heard the soft shivery timbre of locusts punctuated every so often by the watery
croaking of a frog. They were joined by the reedy wheezings of some kind of
flute.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;If you buy one for
your daughter, I can give you another one for yourself for 30% off,&#148; </i>Pike said.</p>

<p class="Story">Desiring to know
precisely how much he should be appalled, Walter did the math: that was about
HK$3,200 for two; and HK$1,600, or $200-plus, each. Walter felt dizzy. He
shook his head, <i>no</i>. &#147;No, thank you,&#148; he said in English.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;15% better than a
sleeping pill, and no side effects!&#148; </i>Pike said, shaking the steaming hamburger
at him. <i>&#147;And this will last you forever! You take the pills, they&#8217;re gone,
but this one lasts forever!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, thank you. No, thank you,&#148; Walter said, backing away from him. The cratered surface of a
moon moved slowly across the nearest laptop screen.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;This is the best
sleep machine in its class! You can&#8217;t find a price this good anywhere else!&#148; </i>Pike said. <i>&#147;You&#8217;re
crazy not to buy!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Walter left the
store and walked out to the mall, whose tiered circles of shops overlooking the
red plastic cones and balls of the Christmas display on the ground floor now
struck him as bearing a striking resemblance to a Dantean vision of hell.</p>

<p class="Story">There was no life raft for him here. He was sunk.</p>

<h2>Sarawak : 2003</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he saran wrap had
held peanut butter sandwiches. Peanut butter and Peptelare sandwiches. Peptelare was a poison created by cooking cough syrup with silica crystals in a
high-pressure environment at exactly 163 degrees. It looked, spread, smelled,
and tasted very much like apple butter. Peptelare had first come to
international attention when it had been ingested by all of the female members
of a cult in Taiwan in a ritual suicide in February 2003. </p>

<p class="Story">Peptelare was
fast-acting, but not instantaneous, so the smallest orangutans had been dead
approximately three minutes after ingesting the poison, plenty of time for
thirty orangutans to gobble up thirty-five peanut butter sandwiches
before realizing that something was wrong.</p>

<p class="Story">The same night as
the O/URC poisonings, there had been a similar infiltration at Camp Leakey in
Kalimantan that had left forty-two orangutans dead. That night someone had
also triggered the security system at Willie Smits&#8217; orangutan center at three
in the morning, but when the night guards had arrived at the breached gate, the
trespassers had gone. For the first forty-eight hours after the discovery of
the murders, both the O/URC and Camp Leakey had strongly hinted to the
Malaysian and Indonesian press that oil palm interests such as Indo-Oil and ICT
Industries were the likely perpetrators of the attacks while several
parliamentary representatives had called Wan and strongly hinted that he needed
to cool it off if he wanted to keep his funding. </p>

<p class="Story">However, that was
as far as tensions had escalated when Al-Jazeera received and featured on its
main news broadcast a video in which an Islamist terrorist group calling
themselves (in Arabic) &#147;Pure Homeland&#148; claimed responsibility for the attacks. </p>

<p class="last">In
the video clip (played over and over again on all of the news
networks&#151;Malaysian, Indonesian, and international&#151;for the next ten days), Pure
Homeland&#8217;s masked leader stated in Arabic: <i>&#147;The targeted orangutan
facilities are the evil tool of foreign governments seeking control over
Oriental resources through Zionist science missionaries. Just like the holy
lands of Palestine and petroleum in Iraq, the interfering foreigners should
leave the fate of Asia, its resources, land, people, and wildlife, to Asia. </i>In&#8217;sh
Allah.<i>&#148;</i></p>

<p class="first">Whoever Pure
Homeland were, they knew their audience. The world population of orangutans,
an endangered species, had been shrinking steadily every day for three decades
without more than a handful of people taking note, and not many terrorist
attacks got more than a ticker tape mention on the news anymore. However,
orangutans killed by terrorists? Now, <i>there </i>was a story.</p>

<p class="Story">Most of the main
news outlets concentrated their attentions on Camp Leakey, but the savvier
editors and producers could see that the O/URC&#8217;s Dr. Wan Mohammed, with his
carefully calibrated balance between rage and sanity, his appropriately dark
sense of humor (his response to the question, <i>Did you ever think that your
orangutans would be targets of terrorism?</i>&#151;<i>&#147;My only regret is not buying any
anti-sandwich security system&#148;),</i> and his genuine sadness regarding the
cooptation of the faith of his childhood by murderous zealots, was the perfect
face of the tragedy to show the liberal West. That that face was fairly easy
on the eyes to boot was one of those lucky strokes of fate that the best money
in the business couldn&#8217;t buy. </p>

<p class="Story">Five film crews
came out to the O/URC during that first, busiest week. Al-Jazeera was in and
out in a few hours with a bilingual reporter and film crew. The scrappy Australian crew drove up in a rusty rented van and set up a satellite
video interview of Wan in his office with their anchor in their Sydney studio. The BBC reporter and her Steadicam operator sat through thorough physical
examinations by Linda to interview Wan inside O.Q. with the caged orangutans in
the background. The two American shoots were, of course, the most difficult,
involving endless negotiations regarding access, power sources, vehicle
parking, compliance with the O/URC&#8217;s quarantine procedures, food, guides,
weatherproofing, and the timing, length, and subjects of the interviews
(eventually: Wan and Will for the broadcast network; Wan, Will, and
Linda for the cable news network). The Americans&#8217; ten most ridiculous
requests, in increasing order of ridiculousness:</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="first"><i>10. Permission to film coverage of the
orangutans in a jungle setting; </i></p>

<p class="first"><i>9. Hot vegetarian and gluten-free lunches
for the reporter, producer, and crew (NO CURRY);</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>8. Reporter access to the orangutans in a
jungle setting;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>7. A photograph of Dr. Mohammed (at any
age) in Islamic dress;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>6. A helicopter tour of the O/URC&#8217;s
research area;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>5. A longhouse and river tour guided by one
of the indigenous members of the O/URC staff;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>4. Private air-conditioned accommodations
for the broadcast network reporter for one hour after lunch; </i></p>

<p class="first"><i>3. Temporary removal of one of the exterior
fences of O.Q.;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>2. Permission to film coverage of Dr. Tsai
performing surgery or another major medical procedure on an orangutan; and</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>1. Permission to film coverage of an
orangutan giving birth.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story">American film crews
ended up taking over the O/URC on three consecutive days. The cable network
shot establishing footage of the O/URC campus and the surrounding forest on the
first day. The cable network shot its interviews on the second day while the
broadcast network shot establishing footage, and the broadcast network shot its
interviews on the last day. All three were long and trying days. Will and Wan
both did really well, as expected, and succeeded in shifting some of the
attention to more systemic problems in orangutan conservation, like poaching and
deforestation due to logging and oil palm. However, the surprise star of the
cable shoot was Linda. The ruder that Linda was to the cable reporter and her producer&#151;both self-made New Yorkers going by their ex-husbands&#8217;
surnames&#151;the more put-upon Linda seemed by their requests, the more exhausted
by their stupidity she seemed, the more that they loved her.</p>

<p class="Story">Four days after the
last film crew packed up its reels and dollies and light meters and booms,
leaving the entire O/URC staff feeling something akin to buyer&#8217;s remorse, <i>The
New Yorker</i> came to Borneo, in the person of Stephanie Walczek, a
thirty-eight-year-old staff writer for the magazine who&#8217;d been nominated
for a Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for her work on a series of <i>Washington Post </i>articles
on the Bosnian war. She met briefly with Wan in his office at the scheduled
time on her first day. Then at the staff meeting that afternoon in meet, she
was there, standing in the back. Five-foot-ten, pale-skinned, with long, wavy
reddish-blonde hair and hazel eyes, Marin watched Walczek out of the corner of
her eye and realized what an alarming presence Will must have been when he&#8217;d
first come to the O/URC. </p>

<p class="Story">After Wan commenced
the meeting, he announced that &#147;Steph&#148; would be profiling him for an upcoming<b>
</b>issue of the magazine, and that she would be approaching everyone
individually for interviews over the next three weeks. Wan then asked Walczek
if she had anything she wanted to say to the staff.</p>

<p class="Story">Walczek cleared her
throat delicately, as if loosening pink blossoms from a spring cherry tree. &#147;I
just wanted to introduce myself,&#148; she said. &#147;Has anyone read the magazine?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin, Will, and
Nolan raised their hands.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Oh!&#148;</i> Walczek said, with
suspiciously quiet rapture. &#147;Great! Good! Wonderful. So some of you know
that the magazine&#8217;s profiles aren&#8217;t expos&#233;s or puff pieces, or news or opinion
pieces disguised as profiles of a particular person. Our profiles are about
people and character and passion&#151;about what drives the extraordinary to do the
extraordinary things that they do. If there&#8217;s past pain involved in their work
now, well, we want to know about that. All of the things&#151;good and bad&#151;that led
Dr. Mohammed to his position at the head of this Center are things that we want
to know.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Annoyed with Walczek,
Marin made eye contact with Will. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Will had
never talked about their night together. At first she&#146;d assumed that it was because there had been too
much going on: investigating the murders, securing O.Q., and burying the dead. Also, Marin, as the O/URC&#8217;s main press contact, had been busy scheduling
interviews and trying to turn all of the reporters&#8217; queries about the attacks
into opportunities to discuss the arboreal nature of wild orangutans, estimated
death rates of the species due to deforestation and poaching, and the 20,000
hectares of rainforest at the edge of the O/URC&#8217;s research area that Indo-Oil
was planning to cut down and turn into an oil palm plantation. </p>

<p class="Story">When things had
calmed down a little bit, Marin had waited for Will to apologize or explain or
at least acknowledge that <i>they had had sex with each other</i>. <i>†</i></p>

<p class="Story">She was still
waiting.</p>

<p class="Story">Will looked away
from her, mimed two legs walking with his index and middle fingers to Anwar:
the O/URC sign for <i>Do you want to go for a hike tomorrow?</i> Anwar gave
him a thumbs up and then pointed to Walczek and made the hiking sign. Will
nodded noncommittally.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
still sat with Will in canteen if they were both there at the same time, and
they were both so evil and compartmentalized that the content and tone of their
conversations during these meals, right down to the amount of teasing and
laughter, was exactly the same as it had been before the fateful night of tuak
boilermakers and unzipped Gore-Tex jackets. However, since that night, over three
weeks ago now, Will and Marin had not gone for a hike together, either alone or
with a third party, and people had to have started noticing.</p>

<p class="first">A few hours after
the staff meeting ended, Walczek&#8217;s driver (apparently Walczek didn&#8217;t know how
to drive) drove Wan, Will, Marin, Anwar, Nolan, and Walczek out to Kuching for
an expense account dinner at a seafood restaurant on the Promenade. </p>

<p class="Story">The air of the
state capital was shot through with a thick, dead heat that night. The bugs
were tiny black acrobats stretching and posing between tricks. The open-air
restaurant that Wan had chosen was decorated in some import-export version of
tiki: hardwood tables covered with red tablecloths, molting tribal masks of
apocryphal origin, and red and white tea candles in wood votives with
Star-of-David-like holes cut into the sides.</p>

<p class="Story">The driver lit a
cigarette and walked away down the dark Promenade smoking, and Walczek and the
O/URCers sat down at a long table overlooking the river. <b>†</b>The river was
black and still with night. Wan ordered for the group: a feast of Malaysian,
Chinese, and Iban seafood preparations that was certain to elicit more sighs of
quiet rapture from Ms. Walczek.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you really,
really don&#8217;t know how to drive?&#148; Anwar asked Walczek.</p>

<p class="Story">Walczek laughed. &#147;Really, really,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone but Marin
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Taking the subway
to work every day is a matter of conscience for a native New Yorker,&#148; Walczek
explained. &#147;It&#8217;s just better for your soul.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Wow</i>,&#148; Nolan
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s your
favorite thing about New York?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I love that it
still intimidates me quite often,&#148; Walczek said. &#147;Just a few weeks ago I was
at a benefit party for Tibetan freedom at the New York Public Library in Bryant
Park. There were these beautiful canap&#233;s on an ice sculpture of the Dalai
Lama, and Robert De Niro was there&#133; and I just felt like I was an
eighteen-year-old girl again, crashing the grown-ups&#8217; party.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone but Marin
sighed quietly with rapture.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ms.
Walczek&#151;Steph&#151;I think that you&#8217;re the coolest person that I&#8217;ve ever met,&#148; Nolan
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And I think that
all of you are the coolest people <i>I&#8217;ve</i> ever met!&#148; Walczek exclaimed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I still can&#8217;t
believe the O/URC is going to be in the freaking <i>New Yorker</i>,&#148; Will
said. &#147;That is just wild.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin watched
Will&#8217;s face as he spoke. She thought that she saw a vein twitch to the side of
his left eye. He wasn&#8217;t in his right mind. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve actually
always been fascinated with monkeys and apes since I was a little girl,&#148;
Walczek said. &#147;They&#8217;re so intelligent. I was looking in Ewald&#8217;s eyes when Wan
took me back to O.Q., and I felt that he saw right into my hard little New
Yorker heart and called <i>bullshit</i>. If Wan hadn&#8217;t been there, I would
have probably started crying.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin knew that
Will hated people who made the orangutans all about themselves, but he, along
with the others, was nodding along with Walczek&#8217;s story and looking wistfully
off into the river.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>This </i>is<i> bullshit</i>,
Marin thought, <i>grade-fucking-A</i>. It had been their job to protect the
orangutans, and they had failed. And instead of being punished for it, instead
of the universe giving them their karmic due, the O/URC was being rewarded with
money (their donations website had crashed with overflow traffic in the hour
after the first U.S. television news profile had aired) and media attention
that NGOs of their size and scope could ordinarily only dream of.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin couldn&#8217;t
stomach this; it upset her terribly; and&#151;most disturbingly of all&#151;it made her
miss Ray Marcos. </p>

<p class="last">Marin
hadn&#8217;t been wrong about Ray; she hadn&#8217;t been wrong to leave Pac. She hadn&#8217;t
changed her mind about that. However, Marin was certain that Ray would have
dismissed Stephanie Walczek as the self-involved lightweight that she was, and
for that alone Marin missed him.</p>

<p class="first">That night, alone
in her bungalow, Marin sat down on the edge of her bed in her nightshirt and
shorts and tried to take an objective inventory of her friends back home, her
world-class education, her parents, her old job at Pac, and everything that had
happened to her since she&#8217;d come to Borneo. She tried to remember why she&#8217;d
come here, but a clear recollection of the Boolean computations of the choice
seemed just out of grasp. </p>

<p class="Story">Anwar, Will, and
Wan were talking about the Walczek dinner on Will&#8217;s porch and laughing. It
seemed to Marin that the darkest heart of the jungle lived in the space between
their laughs. She didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

<p class="Story">It was just a
slight switch in orientation when it hit her, the tiniest ballerina flutter of
neurons. However, as soon as the switch happened, Marin knew that it was the
only thing: she was going to leave the O/URC and travel around Asia alone.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Marin had forgotten
how much she hated being a tourist. She was already in Kuala Lumpur,
half-heartedly browsing K.L.&#8217;s crowded Chinatown street market in the
unfiltered equatorial sun, when she remembered. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t like
the constant cycling of contrived expectations and predictable
disappointments. She didn&#8217;t like the cheap kitsch and pirated goods on sale at
the market. She didn&#8217;t want to take photos of buildings that had held no
special meaning to her until that moment. She didn&#8217;t like that seeing a
McDonald&#8217;s was an aberration to the authentic experience that she was trying to
have; she didn&#8217;t like being reminded that she was the kind of self-important,
compromised person who goes to developing countries to try to have authentic
experiences. She didn&#8217;t like being unable to shake the feeling that she was
making all of her decisions based on faulty information. And she couldn&#8217;t even
enjoy having no purpose but her own pleasure when there were other people
around her&#151;other Asians&#151;busy at work and making a living for their families.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin, starving,
was a few seconds away from the tourist&#8217;s equivalent of mission failure (lunch
at McDonald&#8217;s) when she walked by a food cart with two Chinese families eating
at the plastic tables in front. The sign said &#147;HALAL - SATAY AYAM (CHICKEN) -
SATAY BEEF - RM4 for 3.&#148; Under it, skewers of fatty chicken and beef were
browning over a slim, smoky wood charcoal grill.</p>

<p class="Story">She ordered three
skewers of chicken and three skewers of beef in Amoy. </p>

<p class="Story">The hawker, a
Malaysian-Chinese man her father&#8217;s age, answered in Amoy, <i>&#147;Five minutes. Sit, please.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin sat down at
an empty table and immediately felt better: she could actually do this. </p>

<p class="Story">The satay itself,
when it arrived minutes later, surprised Marin with its excellence: it was
cooked perfectly and was tangy, nutty, meaty, salty, sweet, and mildly spicy. Marin was, in her young life, lucky to have had the absolute best version of
many a thing; she knew intimately the slightly thrilling, slightly anxious
feeling that this induced; and she recognized it now, eating this anonymous
street market satay. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin had eaten
good food in humble places before, but only by being brought to them by some
wise (usually older) person who&#8217;d accumulated such knowledge through many years
of trial and error. The realization that she could stumble upon the absolute
best version of a thing on her own, without hype, pretense, or preamble, was a
revelation.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
stayed on in K.L. for four more nights and saw some Hindu temples, the Petronas
Towers, and a mosque. She bought a Graham Greene novel at the Japanese
bookstore in the mall at the foot of the Petronas Towers. </p>

<p class="first">From K.L., Marin
took a bus to the temperate mountain region of Cameron Highlands. Cameron
Highlands had a sleepy summer camp feel to it. During her five nights there,
Marin toured a large tea plantation, drank lots of tea, ate tom yum soup hotpot
and claypot rice, made small talk with a young French couple staying in her
hostel, and fell asleep at ten o&#8217;clock every night trying to read the first
page of the Graham Greene novel. </p>

<p class="Story">The cool climate
made Marin a little homesick for San Francisco, and, on her last evening there,
she went to an internet caf&#233; and shot an email to Nazneen, Jorge, Ben, Becky,
and Max: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="email" style="margin-bottom:9pt">-MC</p>

</div>

<p class="Story">She clicked &#147;Send,&#148;
the browser window reset to the perfunctory indexing of her inbox page, and she
felt very lonely.</p>

<p class="Story">The timing was the
bitch of it. If her tuak-boilermakers-induced insanity and the Pure Homeland
attacks had happened months apart, Marin felt certain that she could have
handled each with her trademark aplomb: brushed off the former as a drunken
mistake and mourned the latter with an appropriate amount of sobriety and sense
of loss. As it was, she felt deeply, exigently responsible for both and
deeply, exigently bitter at the universe for both, even though one event had
clearly fallen inside the domain of her control and the other had clearly not.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
reached her guesthouse, and walked down the quiet, empty hallway to her room. She unlocked the door, entered, and flicked the light switch. In the jaundiced
dawn of the shaded bulb on the ceiling, Marin&#8217;s bleach-streaked towel, vinyl
toiletries bag caked with soap, and two-year-old clothes looked like the
personal effects of a reclusive leper, not a capable young woman with her whole
life ahead of her.</p>

<p class="first">Marin next went by
bus to the Malaysian city-island-state of Penang, a former Straits colony like
Singapore and Melaka. The name Penang, though not one encountered at all in
Marin&#8217;s undergraduate studies or post-baccalaureate work and life until a few
weeks ago, emitted in its sweet syllables some essential lucre of the
centuries-long project of Asia. </p>

<p class="Story">Although Marin&#8217;s
Chinatown guesthouse left much to be desired in terms of privacy, cleanliness,
and comfort, its surroundings were pleasantly Old World: tumbledown colonial
shophouses with working wooden shutters. It was the end of 2003, and two or
three internet caf&#233;s and a reggae bar staggered among the ancient tailors,
mechanics, noodle shops, and herbalists of the Chinese diaspora seemed the edge
of something important. Marin certainly felt that she was coming close to the
heart of a zeitgeist. </p>

<p class="Story">Indeed, even after
packing what can only be described as a <i>backpack</i> for the carriage of her
belongings for this trip, even after spending five nights in Kuala Lumpur and
five nights in Cameron Highlands in budget guesthouses with lots of Europeans
and Americans dressed like paupers and pilgrims and in possession, also, of <i>backpacks</i>,
Marin had not considered until Penang the possibility that she might be, at
this moment, <i>backpacking</i>. She&#8217;d always thought of backpacking as one of
those sub-pursuits of The Alternative Lifestyle, like skateboarding, veganism,
and dyed hair, that she&#8217;d chosen tattoos and music over a long time ago. </p>

<p class="Story">On her first night
in Penang, Marin had a greasy curry and rice in Little India and then wandered
into a used bookstore next door to the restaurant. </p>

<p class="Story">The bookstore was a
world unto itself. Shelves lined every vertical plane of the shophouse, and
spine-creased books had been stuffed into every available square-inch of every
shelf. A Tamil man whose cheekbones curved downward, like mushroom caps, sat
behind a glass-topped desk piled with books, reading a book. Marin started
browsing. She saw a copy of a Tom Wolfe novel that she would have liked to
leaf through, but it was tied to four other books with twine.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sudhir,&#148; a woman
with a slightly Malaysian-ized Australian accent called out from the back of
the store, &#147;I think you&#8217;re charging too much for your Coetzee.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I charge what any
civilized bookstore would charge for Coetzee, Corinne,&#148; the Tamil man at the
desk said, turning a page in his book and reading.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sudhir, <i>really</i>,&#148;
Corinne said. She emerged from behind the tall bookshelf in the middle of the
store, with two slim paperbacks in her left claw. She was a blonde woman in
her thirties. Her clothes, though backpacker-style in letter, seemed overly
composed, like a costume. She was pretty with a face full of small, delicate
features, but there was something uninviting and severe about her presence. &#147;Would you rather have Generation Y reading Harry Potter?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Sudhir ignored her
and asked Marin, &#147;Can I help you find something?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Corinne almost
answered him but caught her mistake just in time, turned, and noticed Marin for
the first time. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you have any
books on Thailand?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Corinne smiled
sadistically, and Marin knew that there had been many girls needing to know
about Thailand over the years. Marin didn&#8217;t want to know how many years.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your tattoo&#133;&#148;
Sudhir said. &#147;You&#8217;re&#133;&#148; He pulled from a trashcan a folded-up copy of <i>The
Star</i>. &#147;You were working with the orangutan center in Sarawak.&#148; He opened
and refolded the newspaper and held up a pre-Pure-Homeland-attacks picture of
Marin and Nolan eating durian. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Before the
Terrorists&#133;</i>&#148; the headline read. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Mah</i>-rin
Choo?&#148; Sudhir said, reading from the photo caption. &#147;This is you, isn&#8217;t it?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In the flesh,&#148;
said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">Sudhir and Corinne
were both silent for a moment, unsure what to do with this information.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You poor thing!&#148;
Corinne said finally. &#147;What a thing to go through at your age! You&#8217;re doing
the right thing, you know: seeing the world. Getting perspective.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you&#151;&#148; said
Sudhir, &#147;you don&#8217;t sound Malaysian.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m American,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I came to Malaysia to work at the O/URC over a year ago.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Sudhir and Corinne
peppered Marin with questions about the O/URC, her work there, the murders, and
the resulting media attention.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It is so typical
of Malaysians,&#148; Sudhir said, &#147;to only start paying attention to something
important once Westerners get involved.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Unbelievable,&#148;
said Corinne. &#147;So now you&#8217;re going to Thailand?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t blame
you,&#148; said Corinne. &#147;Were you just thinking of taking a bus up across the
border?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah&#133;&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, it&#8217;s quite
cheap from here,&#148; Corinne said. She wanted to talk the backpacker version of
shop. &#147;You should go to Railey Beach first. It&#8217;s on the west coast of
southern Thailand. Everyone knows Phi Phi Island because of that horrible
Leonardo DiCaprio movie, but I like Railey better. And you can go climbing
there, if you&#8217;re even a little sporty. You have to find a bus to Krabi, and
then from Krabi you take a boat to get to Railey.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Sudhir shook his
head. &#147;I&#8217;ve only been Phuket once. It was okay.&#148; He sat down at his desk and
opened his book.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then, if you
cross to the east coast&#133;&#148; Corinne said. &#147;There&#8217;s Koh Samui and Koh Phangan.&#148; She smiled her sadistic smile again.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard
about the Full Moon Parties,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">Every full moon,
backpackers, gap-year Brits, and louche Southeast Asians descended upon Phangan
Island in southern Thailand for an international beach rave. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;When I first went to
Koh Phangan,&#148; Corinne said, &#147;a very long time ago, my friend and I took a
longboat out there, and it was just another pretty island on the east coast. There was nothing to do there but watch the sun rise on the beach. Now it&#8217;s
been overtaken by the Ibiza set.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin knew not to
be jealous of Corinne&#8217;s &#147;authentic&#148; experience of Koh Phangan. Marin had
learned at least this much from the orangutans. Asia&#8217;s occasional splashes of
seductive gypsy magic made certain kinds of visitors identify too personally
with Asia&#8217;s compromises and blandishments. Still, Marin couldn&#8217;t fathom why
Corinne had stayed on, why over so many years the other woman hadn&#8217;t understood
what it had only taken Marin a few weeks to understand: that what was gone was
gone was gone. Staying late at the party won&#8217;t make it last.</p>

<p class="Story">During the next few
days, Marin explored Penang&#8217;s main tourist sites&#151;Penang Hill, the Khoo Kongsi<b>
</b>Chinese clanhouse, historical George Town, and several museums&#151;during
daylit hours, and at night she went to the bookstore in Little India and talked
to Sudhir and Corinne about current events, only occasionally revealing
particulars of a more personal nature. When Sudhir and Corinne found out that
Marin had worked at a development bank in San Francisco, there was a lengthy
inquisition about Pac. Both of them seemed to think that Pac had some kind of
connection to the CIA. </p>

<p class="last">Corinne
gave Marin numerous food recommendations, but as soon as Marin left the
bookstore she could never remember any of them, and neither Sudhir nor Corinne
ever offered to take Marin to these places themselves. After four days, Marin
was ready to move on.</p>

<p class="first">To get to the
southern Thailand town of Krabi, Marin spent ten hours on a mini-bus with a
snoring Dutchman and a driver who, while talking nonstop on his
cellphone, did the equivalent of eighty miles an hour on a two-lane road. From
Krabi, it was a fifteen-minute jeepney ride through the rain to what turned out
to be the wrong beach. The last boat from that beach to the right beach had
just left, so Marin stayed the night at the wrong beach. </p>

<p class="Story">The next morning,
Marin woke up early and walked a few feet down the road for breakfast: Thai
iced tea and a banana pancake. She went back to her hostel, checked out, and
walked to the shore. At the shore, she inquired once again about a boat to
Railey. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t see
any of the boatmen pick up a cellphone or leave their posts on the beach, but
soon enough a tuk-tuk motorcycle cab puttered up to take her to an embankment
where under an overcast sky a bunch of tourists were being shooed into the
water and ushered onto boats by skinny young Thai men. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin rolled up her
jeans and waded in. </p>

<p class="Story">The cabin of the
tiny wooden boat was surprisingly roomy. Marin took a seat in the middle of
the portside bench. The boat filled with passengers, one of the Thai men
untied their anchor, the motor revved, and their little vessel pushed through
the fat muscles of the ocean. When Marin turned to look out the window behind
her, her face filled with spray and sun.</p>

<p class="Story">The beach they
landed at an hour-and-a-half later was gray and windblown. It revealed its
secrets slowly: in a shell of a coconut here and there. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin booked a
single room at a hostel just inland. She had lunch at the hostel
restaurant&#151;greasy drunken noodles and more Thai iced tea&#151;and surveyed the
scene: there were two small coed packs of twenty-somethings, lots of couples
and groups of couples (also mainly in their twenties), and a few lone guys and
pairs of guys, in a gamut of ages and temperaments. These were the tourists,
the secular half of Railey. For, despite its name and proximity to open ocean,
Railey Beach was not a beach town so much as a major rock climbing destination,
famous for its well-routed and gorgeous limestone cliffs. The climbers moved
through Railey&#8217;s makeshift community of travelers that day like a chosen
people, looking important and inaccessible with their gear and ropes strung
over their shoulders. </p>

<p class="Story">The sun came out
during lunch, and Marin went back to her room and changed into her swimsuit and
a jersey sundress. She walked over to the beach on the other side of Railey
after lunch, which was supposed to be nice, according to both Marin&#8217;s Thailand
guidebook and Corinne. Halfway to the beach, Marin passed some backpackers
pointing at and photographing, strangely, a nondescript wall at the side of the
path. </p>

<p class="Story">When Marin got
closer, she saw what had captured the backpackers&#8217; attentions&#151;there was a small
band of baby macaque monkeys running along the head of the wall and up the
branches of a nearby tree. One by one, the squirrel-sized torments raided an
open package of crackers sitting on the wall, until finally one grabbed the
whole lot of it and scurried up the tree, depositing half its contents on the
young woman winking into the viewfinder of her camera below. </p>

<p class="last">Marin
felt an ugly blossom of superiority&#151;macaques were the <i>rats</i> of non-human
primates.</p>

<p class="first">Marin had never
been particularly enamored with beach culture. She had gone with her high
school friends to Lake Michigan on summer weekends, bought bikinis and
brightly-dyed sarongs, laid out in the sun with a silly magazine, and tried to
enjoy herself. She had done two proper beach spring breaks in college: Canc&#250;n
sophomore year and Venice Beach senior year. Throughout all of these
experiences, Marin couldn&#8217;t shake the suspicion that American beach culture was
a mass delusion created by some savvy beach umbrella manufacturer many years
ago.</p>

<p class="Story">When Marin rounded
the last wall of the throughway from the hostel, Phra-Nang Beach came into
view: an acreage of silk blue Poseidon surging and breaking on a seamless
white-white shore. </p>

<p class="Story">It was enough to
make Marin want to fall in love with anyone&#151;any empty-eyed stranger on the
beach&#151;just to transmute the beauty of the ocean into something physical to take
inside her.</p>

<p class="last">Instead,
Marin swam. Marin untied the halter straps of her sundress, pulled it over her
head, dropped it on the sand, and walked to the water. She could hear its long
call; she smelled its eye-burning salts. She waded in without difficulty&#151;the
low-tide waves were strong but not rough. When it got deep enough to duck
under, she felt her hair engorge a gallon of cool and heavy water.</p>

<p class="first">After a long swim,
Marin went back to her hostel to shower. At the balcony just a few feet away
in the second floor of the adjacent bungalow, a large beach towel whipped and
tickled in the wind. On the clothing line above it hung a pink bikini and a
pair of baby-blue swim trunks. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin closed the
door behind her and walked gingerly into the bathroom. The concrete floor felt
cool and unfriendly under her bare feet. She twisted the cross-shaped head of
the faucet on the wall, and water spilled out noisily from its mouth into the
plastic bucket below. She felt cold just watching it.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin dipped the
crusty red scoop hanging on the wall into the bucket and filled it with cold. She tucked her hair behind her ears and dumped the water on her head. It was
cold and then cold again. She scooped. And dumped. And scooped and dumped. She worked her bar of soap into a lather and shot it over her limbs and torso,
over and under her bikini. She took off her swimsuit and rinsed it off in the
sink, wrung it loose of water, and hung it on the hook on the bathroom door to
dry. Then she lathered her breasts and in between her legs, and then scooped
and poured slowly against the front of her body, slowly over her back. Then
she scooped and poured into her hair, combing through it with her fingers to
get the middle wet. She squeezed a coin of shampoo into her palm, rubbed it
vigorously into her wetted hair. Then scooped and dumped and scooped and
dumped. </p>

<p class="Story">Soon enough it was
all over, and there was the illusion of great accomplishment that comes with
the survival of great discomfort. </p>

<p class="Story">As Marin slipped
back into the familiar universe of her underwear&#151;white, cotton, clean&#151;and
flicked water from the inside of her ears, a five-second clip of ordinary
memory (<i>Will sitting in canteen during breakfast and laughing at some lame
joke she&#8217;d made</i>) bottomed out her carefully reconstructed ego. <b>†</b>She
lay down nearly naked on the thin foam mattress of the guesthouse bed and felt
the meager molecules in her sinus almost and yet not accumulate to an actual
drop, stalling behind her eyes. The grief and bitterness inside her felt arid,
clogging: a mass of tangled threads. She hated, hated, hated Will.</p>

<p class="last">In
the middle of a fight with Marin in early 1995, Marin&#8217;s mother had made the
mistake of taking off her wig. Marin had gone ballistic: how could Jinny play
the cancer card during a serious mother-daughter negotiation? Marin had felt
entitled to her own freedom&#151;real life was happening outside of their miserable
suburb and Marin would have to miss out just because her parents were
irrationally frightened of things that they didn&#8217;t understand? She&#8217;d screamed <i>&#147;I
hate you&#148;</i> to her bald, dying mother and meant it.</p>

<p class="first">The next day, Marin
woke up early and purchased a caving and climbing lesson at one of the small
climbing shops on the beach. Her guide/teacher was a young Thai
named Pai. He wore Thai fisherman&#8217;s pants: loose-fitting cotton pantaloons
that folded in and tied at the waist. Marin had seen many backpackers wearing
them in Penang.</p>

<p class="Story">Pai&#8217;s English was
very basic. Marin tried hard not to lapse into annoying baby talk with him,
but she couldn&#8217;t help it for some reason. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So. When you.
Start doing. This climbing?&#148; asked Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh&#133; three?&#151;years
before,&#148; answered Pai. &#147;My friend taught me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You were not
scared&#133; going up high?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Scared?&#148; asked
Pai.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Scared</i>,&#148;
Marin repeated, in case his problem was impending deafness not not knowing a
foreign language. &#147;Afraid? So high there you think you fall?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, no,&#148; said
Pai. &#147;I think my friend will not let me fall.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They walked over to
Phra-Nang Beach the same way Marin had gone the day before. They passed the
wall where the girl had been photographing the macaques. They reached the
beach, and Marin followed Pai down the middle of it. They were the first ones
there&#151;two lone sets of fresh footprints in the tide-smoothed sand. </p>

<p class="Story">Pai led Marin away
from the beach towards a small patch of jungle. The trough of a U-shaped
branch hung directly in their path. Pai lifted it for Marin, the only
available doorman for this door, and motioned her in. </p>

<p class="Story">They hiked a small
distance until they reached the orange shoulder of a mountain. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Look,&#148; Pai said,
gesturing away from the mountain, in the direction from which they&#8217;d come.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin turned and
saw the ocean,
saw it stretch out to a horizon that no one would ever reach, no matter how far
or fast they swam.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay?&#148; said Pai
after a minute. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="last">Pai
turned and led her into the mountain. </p>

<p class="first">Marin buckled the
harness around her waist and walked over to Pai. He was anchoring the rope to
the cave floor. In three too-simple movements, he tied the rope into Marin&#8217;s
harness.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; Pai said. &#147;Very easy. You go back, and the rope hold you. Just keep looking up&#151;and
slowly.&#148; Pai did something quick and important-seeming with the rope. And
then it was time to go.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin walked
backwards over the edge of the drop and felt the rope tighten at her waist and
in her hands; the harness gripped around her, forming the outlines of a seat. She could feel the air behind her and below her, the cool height of nothing. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, now let the
rope, slowly,&#148; said Pai. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin did as she
was told and felt the friction of moving rope in her fingers. She didn&#8217;t move
her feet though, and, after the rope corrected itself and she dropped, they
hung level with her waist, snagged on the rock.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let go your feet!&#148;
yelled Pai, leaning dangerously over the edge so that her eyes met his. She
pulled in her legs as directed and swung away from the limestone and back
again, her feet landing a natural distance below her. &#147;Okay, good!&#148; yelled
Pai, &#147;Now again, let the rope.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The more Marin fed
the rope and negotiated the rock, the more she began to enjoy the fall. She
became conscious of her body as a physical mass, something with density and
weight. None of the usual things mattered here: she was an aimless,
emotionless stone being lowered, a raw good in export. </p>

<p class="Story">The ground came
suddenly, before she was ready, and she collapsed like an abandoned marionette
into the foot of the wall. </p>

<p class="Story">Pai yelled down
instructions at her to untie the rope from her harness, tie it to itself in a
loose knot, and leave it dangling so that he could pull it back up for his own
rapel down.</p>

<p class="Story">After successfully
detaching herself, Marin walked around the mountain to her left and saw the
real climbers&#151;bodies, muscles, leaping up the wide spread of the mountain
beside her, all limbs and no fear. </p>

<p class="Story">Pai had already
found his own way down and noticed Marin&#8217;s interest in the athletics on the
wall.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You want try going
up now?&#148; he asked, untying himself and pulling the rope off the anchor. It snaked
to the ground. &#147;You try.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Pai took out the
climbing shoes that he had brought for Marin, and she squeezed into the
form-fitting rubber-bottomed shoes and pulled the laces in tighter, and
tighter, and tighter.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; Pai said,
carrying the coil of rope to the right-most end of the big wall and dropping it
gently on the ground. He removed his shirt and tied himself back into the
rope. &#147;I go lead climb make line now, okay?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Pai took off, the
rope hanging between his legs like a tail, completing the monkey look. He
posted each yard higher and higher, then anchored the rope&#8217;s top a good sixty
or seventy feet above them, and floated, flew, danced his way down.</p>

<p class="Story">Pai tied a nervous
Marin into the line and stepped back, pulling the rope tight. She stepped
towards the wall until she was face-to-face with it. Tentatively, she felt up
its powdery surface. When she found the first hold, a small cavity above her
right shoulder that she sank her fingers into, and pulled herself one full foot
off the ground, something clicked. <i>You don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. </i>It
was the inexplicability of it: that this seemingly uniform and spartan mass of
wall in fact yielded any number of viable steps to hoist one&#8217;s self up from. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin took step
after step&#151;found tiny, uninviting cracks in the mountainside surprisingly
sturdy and reliable, found other more overt protrusions surprisingly hard to
get a hold of. At one point she nearly fell, but didn&#8217;t&#151;she grabbed the bottom
edge of a large crevice above her and, shaking, moved her foot to a small ledge
to her right. Her legs split apart in a &#147;V&#148; as Pai pulled her rope in tighter,
a bright wind blowing through and making a small space between her ponytail and
neck.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">If zeitgeist had
been what Marin had subconsciously set out to find on this trip, then she found
its frontlines, capital, and court at Khao San Road in Bangkok. Khao San Road
had been accidentally invented by Lonely Planet<i> </i>writer Joe Cummings a
decade ago when he&#8217;d reviewed, positively but very briefly and innocuously, in
an early edition of the Lonely Planet&#8217;s Thailand guidebook, two Chinese-run
budget guesthouses located close to what had been at the time a quiet and
unremarkable Bangkok street. </p>

<p class="Story">(When Marin deduced
this from the public fact pattern later, it reminded her of that old quote from
Marlowe&#8217;s <i>Dr. Faustus</i>: <i>&#147;Was this the face that launch&#8217;d a thousand
ships | And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&#148;</i>)</p>

<p class="Story">Granted, Khao San
Road in 2003 was still not much on paper: a four-block-long stretch of
the city populated entirely with budget backpacker hotels, restaurants, bars,
souvenir shops, internet cafes, travel agencies, dance clubs, massage parlors,
and daily and nightly street markets. However, mixed into the population of
dilettantes and intercontinental truants who rented two-dollar beds and
ten-dollar rooms on Khao San Road were some wild-oat-sowing future leaders of
the Free World, and therein lay Khao San Road&#8217;s relevance and power.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin, already in
need of an upgrade after twenty days of budget fan rentals, checked into a
small A/C room with a private bathroom and hot water shower at a hotel on
Thanon Khao San.<b> </b>She changed from her bus clothes to a sarong
skirt and linen shirt and went out to shop on Khao San Road&#8217;s street market. </p>

<p class="Story">There were no
&#147;topless towers&#148; on Khao San Road, but its market did bear a vague resemblance
to the acropolis of an ancient Greek polis. The street was blocked off to most
automobile traffic, and its sandaled citizenry were engaged in human-scale
exchanges throughout the strip. For sale: joke T-shirts, fisherman&#8217;s pants,
hemp jewelry, rasta caps and flags, glittery head scarves, jersey skirts and
dresses, pygmy elephant and monkey carvings, hair braiding, made-to-order
crepes, deep-fried spring rolls, chicken kebabs. Khao San Road was the town
summer fair of every suburban would-be-bohemian&#8217;s dreams. Marin made her way
to a stall of fisherman&#8217;s pants. The stall&#146;s teenaged girl proprietor was wrapped up
in a conversation on her sticker-covered phone.</p>

<p class="Story">At the next booth
over, a pirated music booth, a Caucasian guy and an Asian girl, both in their
twenties, had a spread of twenty or thirty CDs out by the register and were
arguing with the street vendor in a mix of English and Thai. Marin could tell
from their accents that they were both American, and the boy (Marin had
acquired that idiotic traveler&#8217;s habit of, knowing no one, seeing everywhere
people who reminded her of people &#147;back home&#148;) reminded Marin of her college
friend Ben. This boy had that same incongruous golden-boy-with-a-dark-side
exceptionality about him. Or maybe it was the two motorcycle helmets he was
carrying: a black one hanging by its strap on his forearm and a smaller pink
one cradled over his stomach.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;800 Baht, how much
is that?&#148; said the Ben-like guy, to the girl.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Twenty dollars.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Twenty dollar
only,&#148; repeated the hawker. &#147;Very cheap!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;C&#8217;mon, Bree,
that&#8217;s cheaper than blank CDs.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not really,&#148; said
Bree, who said something more to the vendor in Thai.</p>

<p class="Story">The hawker replied
quickly and, from the gestures he made, appeared to protest first and then
relent. Perhaps sensing who was the more pliable shopper, the hawker added in
English to the American guy, &#147;Only you I give so little. Because your friend
know how to speak Thai.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;d he say?&#148;
the American guy asked Bree.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He said he&#8217;ll give
us two more CDs for the same price,&#148; said Bree.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re already
buying <i>fifteen</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know, Greg,&#148;
Bree said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We could go back
to Chatuchak,&#148; said Greg</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said the
street vendor, &#147;Chatuchak only old CD. New CD only I have.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, but we can
get fifteen CDs there for 200 Baht less than you&#8217;re giving us!&#148; Greg said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;O.K., I give you
sixteen CD, 750 Baht,&#148; said the man.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;G-Cakes, did you
see anything else you wanted?&#148; asked Bree.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, it&#8217;s all just
this dance music crap,&#148; said Greg.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fifteen CDs, 700
Baht,&#148; she said to the hawker.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You like Bob
Marley?&#148; he tried in reply.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No&#133;&#148; Bree said,
glancing briefly at Greg. </p>

<p class="Story">He nodded slightly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Avril Lavigne,&#148;
the hawker said. &#147;Sing-ing very nice.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>No</i>,&#148; Bree
and Greg said in unison.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;O.K. 700 Baht. Only for you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Greg, who
admittedly was growing less and less like Ben by the minute, pulled out a thick
wad of hundred Baht bills and started counting to seven. The vendor bagged
their CDs, and they took off in Marin&#8217;s direction holding hands. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fifteen for seven
hundred&#151;exactly what we wanted, right?&#148; said the girl, Bree.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Exactly what we
wanted,&#148; said Greg. &#147;Good Customer, Bad Customer works every time.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s cause I&#8217;m
such a good Bad Customer, right G-Cakes?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Mm-hm</i>&#133;&#148; Greg pulled the bundle of their clasped hands to his mouth and kissed it. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin tried very
hard to care about colors of pants.</p>

<p class="Story">A high-pitched
ringing in the Americans&#8217; backpack was barely audible amid all the street
noise, but Greg and Bree both heard it. Bree was the one wearing the backpack,
so Greg pilfered through it, found the phone, and answered it. It was for
him. Bree started browsing through a pile of sarongs next to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know, at
Chatuchak&#151;the<i> </i>weekend&#151;market, you can get three of those for 180 Baht,&#148;
Bree said. &#147;Not that anyone needs three pairs of fisherman&#8217;s pants. But you
can get them as gifts or something.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really?&#148; Marin
preened at the insider info. &#147;It&#8217;s already so cheap though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, I&#8217;m Bree,&#148;
said Bree, holding out her hand.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin,&#148; said
Marin. They shook. Bree&#8217;s hands were surprisingly dry, grainy.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where&#8217;re you
from?&#148; Bree studied Marin&#8217;s clothes and hair.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Chicago,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I thought so. Us
too. Not Chicago&#151;but, you know, we&#8217;re American too.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That was one of my
men,&#148; said Greg, hanging up the phone and coming over to Bree, &#147;He thinks his
monk cousin will talk to me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s great,
G-Cakes. Why don&#8217;t you explain what you&#8217;re doing to Marin here.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Greg
laughed, incredulous. &#147;You&#8217;re amazing Bree,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#8217;m on the phone for
five minutes and you already have a new best friend.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">They were Bree
Praddakayap and Greg Murray, Fulbright Scholars, winners of grants funding
their living expenses and research in Bangkok for a year. Bree, a
first-generation Thai-American born and raised in Rockville, Maryland, was
studying the effects of macroeconomic policy in Southeast Asia in the years
following the 1997 Asian economic crisis. Greg originally hailed from
Scranton, Pennsylvania and was interviewing a bunch of Bangkok men for his
doctoral dissertation (he was in the fourth year of his Ph.D. in religious
studies at UCLA) on the annual Rain Ritual monastic retreat, a rite of passage
performed by most Thai men sometime between graduation and marriage. </p>

<p class="Story">Greg said, &#147;Americans
have spring break in Canc&#250;n and booty dancing at frat parties&#133; the Thais have&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nirvana,&#148; quipped
Bree. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Or three months in
an orange robe trying to get there,&#148; said Greg, unable to let the joke slip by
unqualified.</p>

<p class="Story">They exchanged all of the usual questions. Marin didn&#8217;t exactly lie, but she did skip over the
Borneo section of her resume and let the Fulbrighters assume that she had been
working at Pac the entire time since graduation.</p>

<p class="Story">Bree and Greg
invited Marin to dinner in two days on Friday night, and then the Fulbrighters
strapped on their helmets and mounted and sped off on their motorcycle to
someplace else. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin hung around
Khao San Road for the rest of the day, trying to read the damned Graham Greene
and logging less than a page per reading location. </p>

<p class="Story">On Thursday, she
visited Bangkok&#8217;s key sites: its gold-spired palace and an adjoining Buddhist
temple. As Marin stared at the forty-six-meters-long gold-plated reclining
Buddha statue, she wondered if maybe mankind was doomed to always turn things
into the opposite of what they were supposed to be.</p>

<p class="Story">On Friday, she
traveled out of the city center to Chatuchak Market and bought two pairs of
fisherman&#8217;s pants, a blue-and-white hibiscus-print skirt, and a necklace of
wooden prayer beads. The purchases had a nice aggregate weight-to-utility
ratio about them. </p>

<p class="Story">Khao San Road each
night was a crossroads of unimaginative, down-market sin. Alcohol, nicotine,
flashing lights, and pop music&#151;walking the length of the night market strip
through moist hives of drunken Brits and bored backpacker couples on Wednesday
evening, Marin actually felt nostalgic for a Joss-curated playlist. Thankfully, Khao San Road&#8217;s night market had some decent street food:
flash-fried pad thai; black rice with condensed milk and mango; and Thai iced
tea. This, in fact, was Marin&#8217;s dinner two nights in a row. </p>

<p class="Story">The next night, it
was finally time for Marin to wait for her pickup on the designated street
corner. </p>

<p class="Story">Sixteen minutes
late, a navy blue car pulled up in front of Marin, and a window rolled down. Bree, in the driver&#8217;s seat, wearing lipstick and mascara, her thick hair down
and ironed straight, smiled and waved brightly.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Sorry,
we&#8217;re late!&#148; she said. &#147;I hate driving in this stupid town.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Greg was riding
shotgun, and in the back seat with Marin was another Fulbrighter named Lisa, a
Ph.D. candidate in cellular biology, and Lisa&#8217;s boyfriend, a Russian-American
computer programmer named Yuri. Yuri hadn&#8217;t gotten a Fulbright, but he and
Lisa hadn&#8217;t wanted to spend the year apart so he had come with her and they
were living off Lisa&#8217;s grant money together. </p>

<p class="Story">Bree, Greg, Lisa,
and Yuri talked about the hazards and quirks of living as Americans in Bangkok,
and Bangkok itself passed by&#151;light shops five layers deep in lit lamps and
chandeliers; the multicolored bonanza of dollar stores; emblem-faced banks;
gambling halls filled with the craned heads of men; and the dusty square butts
of air conditioners hanging over the street&#151;all connected by an omnivorous
Celtic knot of traffic-backed ramps and roads. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wait, are we
expats?&#148; Bree asked. Someone else had just used the &#147;E&#148; word.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I always thought
of expats as, like, bankers in Hong Kong or whatever,&#148; Greg said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, expats are any
foreigners living in a less developed country than where they&#8217;re from,&#148; Yuri
said. &#147;So even broke-ass Russians in Thailand: we are expats.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re farangs,&#148;
Greg said. &#147;That&#8217;s Thai for <i>&#8216;white devil,&#8217;</i>&#148; he explained to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not a farang,&#148;
Bree said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Will were
both technically expats by Yuri&#8217;s definition. Perhaps what had happened
between her and Will had been as inevitable as Bree and Greg dating in Bangkok:
just two expats constructing the simplest version of an expat community
together. </p>

<p class="Story">Human nature: was
it an oxymoron or not? </p>

<p class="Story">There was,
thankfully, one authentic Thai citizen meeting this particular five-some of
exported patriates at the dinner restaurant. Greg and Bree had met this
person, Thaksin &#147;Ducky&#148; Chaluallakorn, at a mutual acquaintance&#8217;s lavish
engagement party at the Bangkok Four Seasons a few months ago, and they had all
become friends.</p>

<p class="Story">Bree parked in a
lot, and their group walked into the restaurant, Rai Chiang, together. Rai
Chiang&#8217;s interior walls had bright pine-colored wood paneling. In the middle
of the room were large tanks filled with water and edible marine life:
gray-orange crabs and lobsters crawled up glass as big-cheeked fish sidled up
to corners and stared. </p>

<p class="Story">All of the dining
furniture was modern and Asian: shiny black tables and low-backed black chairs
with lime green bamboo print cushions. Well-to-do Thais filled the room. About one-third of the tables had at least one white person in their party. The air smelled of ginger, basil, chili, and the richest oils of the richest
meats. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Uhh</i>&#133;&#148; said
Yuri. &#147;This place looks expensive.&#148; He looked stressed out by this.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s expensive
compared to Khao San Road,&#148; said Greg, &#147;but it&#8217;s not too bad.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Uhh</i>&#133;&#148; Yuri
said again. &#147;Yeah.&#148; He whispered something to Lisa, who nodded and whispered
something back to him. Yuri&#8217;s ears moved backwards like a cat&#8217;s as he
listened. Whatever she had said to him, it made him look no less stressed out.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s group was
seated right away, and Greg and Bree ordered beer and appetizers for everyone:
deep-fried fish skin, green papaya salad, and chicken curry puffs. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I get to this
monk&#8217;s house for the interview,&#148; Greg said, continuing a story he&#8217;d begun in
the car.</p>

<p class="Story">Three large bottles
of Singha beer arrived, and the waitress set the bottles and six frosted
glasses down in front of Bree. Greg reached over and poured all six beers,
distributed them around the table, and took a long drink from his own glass as
he continued talking.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And this
four-foot-five Thai woman answers the door. And I introduce myself, ask if Mr.
So-and-So-long-ass-Thai-name is home. She doesn&#8217;t say anything so I explain
that I&#8217;m doing my Ph.D. in religious studies and am doing a comparative
analysis of the Rain Ritual in Thailand to coming-of-age practices for
adolescent and young adult males in other religions and cultures around the
world. You know, my whole shtick. She says, and I quote: &#8216;You talk a lot,
making people very tired, I think.&#8217;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Bree and Lisa
giggled. Yuri narrowed his eyes at a huge pile of crab at the next table
over. Marin wondered if, like in a cartoon, it looked like a huge pile of
money to him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What. The. Hell.&#148; Greg continued, &#147;I thought I was going to see a monk, not a psychic.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow, she <i>owned</i>
you, G-Cakes,&#148; Bree said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You don&#8217;t make me
tired, Greg,&#148; Lisa said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not &#8216;very&#8217;
anyway,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And then I hear
this man screaming in Thai in the background.&#148; Greg rattled off a stream of
syllables that sounded like fluent Thai to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whoa,&#148; said Bree,
looking disturbed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess I said
that right,&#148; Greg said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What was it?&#148;
asked Lisa.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thai men are
evil,&#148; Bree said, shaking her head.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thai men are <i>e-</i>vil?!&#148;
a very tall and attractive young Thai man standing at the head of their table
exclaimed playfully. He was wearing a dark gray blazer over a T-shirt and
shorts and pulled a bottle of champagne from a Duty Free bag and placed it on
the table. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky!&#148; Bree,
Lisa, and Greg shouted in unison.</p>

<p class="Story">Yuri smiled for the
first time since Marin had met him.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky somehow
wrinkled up the box-thick construction of the Duty Free bag into a ball
and&#151;Marin would remember this years later, with Parisian faux regret, as a bad
omen that she had not heeded&#151;<i>dropped it on the floor</i>. </p>

<p class="Story">Their group shifted
chairs so that an empty chair opened up in the front near Ducky, across from
Bree.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And what about
Thai women?&#148; Ducky said, taking the empty seat. He had a British accent,
Queen&#8217;s English. &#147;You&#8217;re just innocent bystanders in all of this, I suppose?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The appetizers
arrived, along with&#151;magically&#151;champagne flutes. Ducky popped open the
champagne under the table, and began pouring it into the flutes.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where were you
coming back from when you got this champagne?&#148; Bree asked. &#147;Let me guess&#151;&#148; She closed one eye. &#147;Frankfurt?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Close,&#148; Ducky
said. &#147;Bern, actually.&#148; He popped a fried fish skin chip in his mouth.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How&#8217;s Switzerland
these days?&#148; Greg asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cold,&#148; Ducky said,
between crunches. &#147;I must be spending too much time in Europe because these
fish skins taste fucking brill.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky, this lovely
lady here is Marin Choo,&#148; Greg said. &#147;Bree picked her up on Khao San Road a
few days ago. Marin is half-Chinese, half-Filipino, from Chicago originally, a
Stanford grad, worked for the Pac Development Bank, got tired of that, and is
now traveling around Southeast Asia for a few months.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very excellent to
meet you,&#148; Ducky said. &#147;Bree &#8216;picked&#8217; you &#8216;up&#8217; on Khao San Road? What does
that mean?&#148; He passed around the filled champagne flutes.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It means that Greg
does not satisfy Bree sexually anymore,&#148; Lisa said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky laughed. &#147;So
she went looking for action on Khao San Road?&#148; he said. &#147;And she found you?&#148;
he said to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Something like
that,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re just
traveling around Asia?&#148; Ducky asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think so,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;I&#8217;ve only been in Malaysia and Thailand so far.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What about
Cambodia?&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m thinking about
that next,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Angkor Wat?&#148; Ducky
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I would love to
see Angkor Wat,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s your lucky
day,&#148; Ducky said. &#147;I have <i>the</i> Angkor Wat connection.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">He pulled out his
handheld communication device, and thumbed some of its tiny buttons. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;When would you
like to leave for Angkor Wat?&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sunday,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky thumbed more
tiny buttons.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s your email
address?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;mchoochoo@whatmail.com,&#148;
Marin said. She spelled her username for him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay&#133;&#148; he said,
typing. &#147;And that&#8217;s&#133; how it&#8217;s&#133; <i>done</i>. You are now booked on <i>the</i>
best shuttle from Bangkok to Siem Reap: air-conditioning, Japanese utility
vehicle, and English-speaking driver who is actually acquainted with some basic
traffic laws, incredibly enough. Pick-up is on Khao San Road on Sunday morning
nine o&#8217;clock, and drop off is between seven and eight p.m at a very nice
guesthouse in Siem Reap. They have a huge library, decent cook, and the rooms
are well-appointed, charming, comfortable&#151;it&#8217;s quite the bargain actually. My
mate A.J. is based there and can arrange tours of the ruins upon your arrival.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky has mates
everywhere,&#148; Bree said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;All named A.J.
too,&#148; Greg said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He has <i>girls</i>
everywhere too,&#148; said Lisa.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Also, coincidentally,
all named A.J.,&#148; Greg said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Uh-huh</i>,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I do not have
mates, girls, anyone, anywhere,&#148; Ducky said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s make a
toast,&#148; Yuri said, raising his champagne flute.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;To A.J.!&#148; Greg
said, raising his flute.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;To A.J.!&#148; they
said, clinking flutes.</p>

<p class="Story">The champagne was
cold, bitter, and sweet. Not the most authentic Thai beverage in the world to
be sure, but Marin didn&#8217;t let that bother her. How liberating it was to be
around fun and smart Americans! How much less explication and qualification
everything required! A travel-arrangements-arranging Thai with a well-stamped
passport wasn&#8217;t bad either.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky got up and
switched seats with Yuri so that he was sitting across from Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So where&#8217;d you get
your tattoo?&#148; Ducky asked her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>&#8216;The secret of
being a bore is to tell everything,&#8217;</i>&#148; Marin said, feeling liberated enough
to quote Voltaire.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky laughed. &#147;Gorgeous, funny, and mysterious,&#148; he said. It wasn&#8217;t clear to whom he was
providing this summary.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin did not think
that Ducky was a serious person, but something made her want to take him
seriously. And, frankly, she didn&#8217;t want to think too deeply about why.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">The bus to
Cambodia, the guesthouse, and A.J. were everything that Ducky had promised. Marin felt very spoiled. It had all been too easy. She felt on edge, waiting
for the other shoe to drop.</p>

<p class="Story">She woke up at four
a.m. on her first morning in Siem Reap to go over with A.J. by tuk-tuk to the
main Angkor Wat temple for sunrise. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s bones and
joints burned with the pain of being torn prematurely from their eden of rest. In the dry orange light of the guesthouse gate lamps, A.J. waited for her. He
was friendly without being intrusive or chatty, and the drive over to the park
that housed the eight-hundred-year-old temples and ruins of Angkor was bumpy
but quiet. Marin couldn&#8217;t see much&#151;it was still very dark out&#151;and fell asleep
briefly, but when they reached the gate and bought Marin&#8217;s ticket, it was light
enough to admire the smoothness of the black concrete road, the narrow lines of
leaf-filled trees against a gray-green sky. </p>

<p class="Story">Inside the park,
paddies of still black water soaked the bottoms of grass-crowned rows of rice. The sky was still and shallow as the water.</p>

<p class="Story">An unexpectedly
lengthy time and distance later they reached what could only be Angkor Wat: a
long stone wall framing a tumble of rosette-roofed towers, the wall in turn
surrounded by a placid moat. </p>

<p class="Story">A.J. dropped Marin
off at the entrance and joined the many other drivers and guides parked in the
gravel pit across the street. Marin crossed the moat bridge without fanfare. Several hundred tourists were already lined up along the inside wall of the
temple. They were camped out on the grass and stairs. Marin passed them and
headed into the complex, walking up and down the cascade of stairs and
corridors to the back, easternmost end of the building, where the sun was
already starting to color and whiten and sidle its way up.</p>

<p class="Story">It was a massive
ball of gas, and an arc of one of its satellite planets was rotating into view
of it. The stone wall of Angkor Wat was cool under Marin&#8217;s palm. She was
moving closer to the sun; they all were. Its light cast long shadows in the
temple that would disappear at noon. </p>

<p class="Story">For one moment,
Marin Choo could live with herself and everything she&#8217;d always done wrong.</p>

<div class="sun"><%= image_tag "books/o/ch18.png", alt: "Chapter 18" %></div>
<h2>San Jose : 2005</h2>
<h3>Walter</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">W</span>alter refused to be jealous of the business
travelers in the San Jose airport. They were no different from him. Their
suits, their maxed-out voicemail boxes, their key-locked laptops: all of these
were just affects. Their lives were not really any more serious or full of
genuine urgency than his. Capitalism could go on with or without them, too.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter had
carried-on his bag and after exiting the terminal went straight to the
sidewalk-facing car rental desk outside baggage claim. He stood on the short
line. It was sunny and so warm that Walter had to remove both his jacket and
sweater.</p>

<p class="Story">It had been snowing
when Walter had driven to O&#8217;Hare Airport that morning: just some harmless
flurries, but the forecasters were saying that there would be six inches of
accumulation by tonight. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter used to
pride himself on not being one of those idiots who acted surprised and put-out
by the perfectly predictable seasonal changes that came to the American Midwest
and Northeast every single December, January, February, and March. However,
the moment that the wheels of Walter&#8217;s post-Thanksgiving return flight from
Hong Kong had sanded into runway, the ice and wind chill and dirt-sloshed snow
that had overtaken the metropolis in his absence had seemed to him the public
face of the enemy in the critical decades-long war that, unbeknownst to him, he&#8217;d
been badly losing. </p>

<p class="Story">For most of
December, Walter had tried to use Sun Tzu tactics to combat his enemy. He had
gotten it in his head that he could turn the ice on his roof against the snow
on his driveway, and vice versa. </p>

<p class="Story">Loyola had some
reliable-seeming local climate data online. Walter had dusted off his
equation-writing skills and ran some numbers. He&#8217;d dug out a ten-year-old pad
of graph paper from Jinny&#8217;s work stuff and drawn diagrams and graphs. He&#8217;d
woken up between three and four in the morning every night (the exact time
shifted parabolically in accordance with his calculations) to shoot salt onto
his roof with a Respiatin-branded Nerf ball gun. </p>

<p class="Story">His neighbor&#8217;s
fifteen-year-old son had come by one day and asked if he could shovel Walter&#8217;s
driveway for fifteen bucks, and Walter had instead paid the boy $15 to climb up
a ladder and pour a bucket of boiling water into Walter&#8217;s storm drain so that
he could measure the resulting velocity and spread of melt. </p>

<p class="Story">The next morning,
Walter&#8217;s driveway had been cleared&#151;but the piles of snow to the sides of and
the square shovel marks on the cleared driveway had indicated that it likely had
not been Walter&#8217;s nightly roof-saltings that had done the trick. </p>

<p class="Story">As Walter had driven
to the express courier box in a Naperville commercial strip to overnight his
signed &#147;Early Mutual Termination of Employment Agreement&#148; to 220 South Wacker a
few days after the covert shoveling operation, the sleet falling in
back-slashes onto his windshield ( / / / / / / / / ) had seemed to him clear
evidence of his enemy&#8217;s last gasp before its impending doom.</p>

<p class="Story">This had been the
awesome state of mind that Walter had been in when he&#8217;d gotten Jim Valiant&#8217;s
email five days after Christmas. The first time that Walter had read through
Jim&#8217;s proposition, he actually hadn&#8217;t been sure that he, Walter, had not
already become too divorced from his own competencies, too advanced in
accepting the deteriorations of his age, to take on such a tricky task. </p>

<p class="Story">New Year&#8217;s had come
and gone in a blur of obsessive-compulsive tinkering with his thermostat and
heater. </p>

<p class="Story">Then, one early
January morning Walter had woken up feeling like Dr. Walter Choo, senior
manager of sales. Jim had pushed him back two weeks and another two weeks, and
by the time Jim had called him up and said, <i>&#147;Oh, just come out and I&#8217;ll get
something on the calendar, this is ridiculous,&#148;</i> Walter had put enough of
himself back together to pack a good suitcase of clean, pressed clothes and all
the necessary toiletries and get on a flight to California to see his old rep
and unemployed daughter.</p>

<p class="last">And
suddenly Walter&#8217;s enemy was nowhere in sight. On a landscaped median in the
distance, an armistice line of squat palm trees stood in passive fraternity
with the breeze. </p>

<p class="first">A beachy summer song came onto the radio as
Walter motored down the highway in his rented sedan: a young man playing
syncopated acoustic guitar and singing breezily to some girl who&#8217;d left him. Walter had heard the song many times before, on many a company car radio in the
field with one of his reps, but the song had seemed odd and retro until now,
with its combination of breezy melody and bittersweet situation. Here,
surrounded by all the terracotta, bright orange, and yellow things that were
ordinarily gray or beige in the Midwest, the song didn&#8217;t sound retro; it
sounded like a powerful incantation to keep the slate-eyed ice goblins from the
eastern five-sixths of the country away.</p>

<p class="Story">There were more
palm trees planted on the concrete-ringed grass mounds in front of Walter&#8217;s
chain business hotel. </p>

<p class="last">Walter
checked in and showered. It was almost noon by that time. He was supposed to
meet Jim at one o&#8217;clock at Hot Pot City, an all-you-can-eat Chinese hot pot
buffet in Milpitas.</p>

<p class="first">On the way to lunch, Walter drove past the
offices of one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its low-rise
contempo-corporate exterior looked not much different from that of the
Naperville Public Library. Maybe earthquake skittishness had prevented the
high-tech giant&#8217;s executives from wanting to build taller and flashier, or
maybe the building&#8217;s nondescript design was a statement that the power of the
new economy was not in any physical monument but the tiny chips of metal that
the company designed.</p>

<p class="Story">Hot Pot City was in
a ten-year-old strip mall complex populated exclusively by Asian restaurants
and stores, including a large Asian grocery store. Hot Pot City anchored one
of the corners of the complex. Walter pulled into the mall lot and tried to
find a decent parking spot. The mall was full of Asians and non-Asians of all
ages, including an inordinate number of Chinese men Walter&#8217;s age who dressed
and cut their hair exactly like him. Walter drove past two Chinese men walking
together from their car to Hot Pot City: one of them was wearing a shirt that
Walter owned in a different color and the other was wearing a pair of loafers
that Walter had bought on sale at a factory outlet in Wisconsin last summer.</p>

<p class="Story">A nice spot opened
up, and Walter pulled into it, coming hood-to-hood with a beautiful blue
Mercedes with eleven-inch rims.</p>

<p class="Story">Jim Valiant would
be thirty-five years old now. He had joined Fenniskrante in 1992 fresh out of
Kansas State, where he&#8217;d double-majored in business and psychology. The son of
a small-town kindergarten teacher and convenience store manager, Jim had been
smart, hungry to learn, and extremely hard-working for his entire six-year
tenure as a rep in Walter&#8217;s territory. Shorter than Walter by three inches at
five-foot-seven, Jim had started losing his hair at twenty-five (and had not
been Brad Pitt to start with), but he still had tracked well with single female
nurses. Jim Valiant was one of those nice, sincere, smart white guys that
Walter thought of as &#147;Honorary Asians,&#148; and, in fact, Jim had married a very
pretty Filipino-American Kaiser formulary administrator at Stanford&#8217;s Memorial
Church five years ago. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter opened the
door to Hot Pot City to a salvo of sights, smells, and sounds that seemed
curated to suit his exact predilections. Businessmen and engineers argued the
finer points of market strategy over steaming pots of soup and foil-wrapped
grills smoking with the charred pupae end-fat of short ribs. Young Filipina
moms in jeans and tennies peeled boiled shrimp for their children and sipped at
improvised soda fountain creations. Out-of-towners and other shameless
value-optimizers loaded plates with prime cuts of beef and the biggest pieces
of shellfish. One of the plate-loaders was Jim Valiant. Jim saw Walter and
raised a plate of mussels and soft shell crabs to him in greeting.</p>

<p class="Story">They met each other
halfway, by the salad bar, and Jim walked Walter to their table. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Doc Choo, you made
it! Good, good. How was your flight? Lunch is on GSK, of course, so load up
freely, my friend,&#148; Jim said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not if I was a
real doctor, it wouldn&#8217;t be,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ha-ha, some Prop
66A humor, I like it,&#148; said Jim.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Anyway, looks like
you&#8217;ve got half the dollar value of the buffet right there, Jim,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, if your
style hasn&#8217;t changed since the old days, I knew I&#8217;d better get a bucket of the
best,&#148; Jim said. He hammed up a grin.</p>

<p class="Story">They reached their
table. The gas was on under the pot, and Walter lifted the lid to check the
soup: only tiny bubbles at the bottom of the pot.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No boil yet, huh?&#148;
Jim said.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter replaced the
lid.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How&#8217;s Veronica?&#148;
Walter asked. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Good!&#148; Jim said,
turning up the gas. &#147;Good. She took the GMAT last month.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Veronica wants to
go to B-school? Really?&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;She&#8217;s thinking
about it. She doesn&#8217;t really need to do it, but she really wants to leave
Kaiser, and it&#8217;s the most diplomatic way to do it rather than jumping straight
to a competitor.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That seems like a
strange reason to get an MBA,&#148; Walter said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And, obviously&#133;&#148; Jim grinned again. &#147;I&#8217;m a pretty diplomatic guy, but I&#8217;m all for the jumping
to a competitor thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you didn&#8217;t
need to get an MBA to do it,&#148; Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, six years
with you were better than any business school, Walter,&#148; Jim said. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter felt a rush
of saturation in his cheeks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Seriously, Doc,
it&#8217;s true,&#148; Jim said. &#147;I&#8217;ve always wanted to tell you. And now that
Fenniskrante has most retardedly screwed you over, I finally can.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The top of the pot
lid suddenly matted over with condensation. Walter lifted the lid, and
revealed a pot of chicken stock at boil. Jim dropped some slices of beef, a
few mussels, and a soft shell crab into the pot with expert chopsticks work. When Walter had met Jim thirteen years ago, the boy had barely been able to
pick up a single noodle off his plate without a fork.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, you were a
great student,&#148; Walter said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, here&#8217;s the
thing, Walter. GSK-California isn&#8217;t afraid of change. We are down with
change. We weren&#8217;t sure if Prop 66A would pass; it did. The voters have
spoken, as is their right. And we have to adapt. But we need fresh eyes for
that, someone who doesn&#8217;t take our status quo way of doing things for granted. I&#8217;m one of the few folks with more than two years pharm sales experience
outside GSK, so this is something I talked about with my veep even before
November 2. Who can we bring on from outside the company that we can actually
trust? You came to mind as the ideal type&#151;Ph.D. in chemistry, twenty years
experience, trained hundreds of top reps, you&#8217;ve been inside the Lugano
lab!&#151;but I told my veep, <i>&#8216;Walter Choo would never leave Fenniskrante,
never.&#8217;</i> But then&#151;lo and behold!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what are we
talking about here, exactly, Jim?&#148; Walter asked. &#147;I trained you too well. You&#8217;ve never actually used the word &#8216;job&#8217; yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">Jim
laughed. &#147;Well, it&#8217;s up to you. You want to do part-time, we can do
part-time. You want to focus on Northern California, we can get people for the
rest of the state. You want to be the person running the show, that spot is
still open as of now. The veeps want the Prop 66A response development off
their plate ASAP, I can tell you that much. There are some internals pitching
decks tomorrow; there are a few other externals pitching decks. I know most of
the names, and, I&#8217;m not unbiased, but in the humble opinion of yours truly
you&#8217;re by far the most qualified candidate.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Returning to his hotel room alone after
what should have been an ego-inflating, bitterness-vindicating lunch, Walter
instead felt more uneasy. He hadn&#8217;t worked with Jim in seven years. The
younger man was obviously idealizing his former mentor&#8217;s abilities. And maybe
Walter&#8217;s twenty years of glorified effort were enough for Kansas-small-town-boy-made-good
Jim Valiant, but the hiring committee of executives and recruiters would be
like Eric Mulrhony: they&#8217;d want charm from Walter, charm that he did not
possess. He was a good salesman&#151;not the best, not indispensible&#151;just good. He
didn&#8217;t want to be the guy who couldn&#8217;t accept that, who clung on to his own
tiny moral victories long after they&#8217;d ceased being relevant.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter unpacked his
laptop from its Identol-branded polyurethane casing and opened it, folding its
screen back ninety degrees. He plugged the computer&#8217;s power cord into the
outlet under the desk and pressed its power button on.</p>

<p class="Story">He double-clicked
the shortcut to the presentation program. A welcome window opened with his
five most recent decks: all sales training decks that he&#8217;d done last spring and
summer, all saved in the folder C:\My_Documents\FNSK. Walter clicked on the
New Document icon and saved his new deck as &#147;GSK-Pitch&#148; in a new folder in
My_Documents, &#147;GSK.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter Choo had
only ever sold drugs. Even if the research and data behind sales details had
been sometimes questionable or thin, there had always been some germ of
scientific truth to extrapolate from. Walter couldn&#8217;t sell himself the same
way he&#8217;d sold Perpetua or Petrazin. </p>

<p class="Story">Except, that was
it, wasn&#8217;t it? Walter was a drug. GSK-California had been hit with the nasty
new bacterium of Prop 66A, and Walter was its cure.</p>

<p class="Story">Once Walter
realized this, everything clicked. The shape of his presentation began to form
and fill out in his mind faster than he could get it down on the slides, and he
didn&#8217;t move from his computer for nearly five hours. When he printed the
finished deck on the toaster-sized laser printer in the business center
downstairs, bound it with a black clip, and skimmed through its fifty
beautiful, brilliant pages, he knew with absolute certainty that it was the
best work that he&#8217;d ever done.</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Walter searched through the entire FM band
three times, trying to find that acoustic beach song he&#8217;d heard the day
before. He wanted that acoustic beach song. The incredible events of that
afternoon at GSK&#8217;s offices in Redwood City were inducing an escalating,
unwholesome ecstasy that he needed to anchor in something cool and
Californian. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter was about to
give up on the song and settle for the oldies station when he found it. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes!&#148; he said,
pounding the driver&#8217;s window with the fat outer end of his fist. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter thought that
he could feel his serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake being
seriously inhibited as he turned up the volume. He reached into the paper bag
in the passenger&#8217;s seat and pulled out the fast food roast-beef-and-cheddar
sandwich that he&#8217;d bought for lunch after leaving GSK. He tasted the warm
salty meat and soft bread of the sandwich with a dulling, disorienting
three-second delay. Walter balled up the empty wax wrapper, dropped it in the
bag, sucked liquid cheese off his thumb, and banged on the steering wheel along
with the song.</p>

<p class="Story">They had loved
him. They wanted him to head up their entire Prop 66A strategy for
California. He was going to start in one month.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter drove past a
series of billboards and hills full of houses and then the city, San Francisco,
pulled into view. His GPS told him to move to the left lane for his exit. </p>

<p class="Story">Next to Chicago&#8217;s
unimpeachable lineup of American classics, San Francisco&#8217;s skyline had always
seemed inadequate to Walter: stubbornly, hopelessly piecemeal and off. Was it
fickle and self-serving of him to now find its collection of unpretentious
skyscrapers and knobby peaks effortlessly charming? </p>

<p class="Story">Walter drove down
the exit ramp and onto a street of warehouses. His GPS told him to drive
straight and cross under the highway. </p>

<p class="last">A few
minutes later Walter was in Marin&#8217;s neighborhood looking for parking. A good
spot opened up in front of a house with a faded &#147;YES on Prop 66A&#148; sign in its
window, and Walter pulled into it, chuckling at how life came together
sometimes in the most unexpected of ways. </p>

<p class="first">Walter rang his daughter&#8217;s buzzer and the
gate and front door vibrated open. He climbed the stairs to the second floor
and knocked on her door. Charlie opened it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Marin tells me
that some serious congratulations are in order, Walter,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, no, no,&#148;
Walter said. &#147;It&#8217;s just a job. Hopefully I didn&#8217;t oversell myself today.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Charlie opened the
door all the way and stood aside. Walter walked into the apartment, and Marin
simultaneously walked into the living room from the kitchen, pouring red wine
into a wine glass. She handed Walter the filled glass.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I thought a
celebratory drink was in order,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re going to
be moving here! Hold on, let me get more glasses.&#148; She went back into the
kitchen.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mare, do you want
to get out that extra wedge of Mt. Tam, too?&#148; Charlie said. He followed her
into the other room.</p>

<p class="Story">Walter&#8217;s daughter
had redecorated since he&#8217;d last been inside her apartment. There was a
beautiful new couch, a large white chrome bookcase, a large flatscreen TV, and
two C-shaped red coffee tables. He hoped that Charlie hadn&#8217;t bought all of this
stuff for Marin. On the wall above the couch were two paintings: Walter sipped
at his wine and walked over the couch to look at them. They were strange: one
was of a farm and village, painted in a rough style in very bright colors, with
a bottle of efavirenz in the upper-left-hand corner; the other was of the
Virgin Mary, with a bottle of saquinavir where Mary&#8217;s face should have been. Efavirenz and saquinavir were two HIV medications, but they were never used
together because efavirenz dramatically lowered blood levels of saquinavir,
rendering it ineffective. </p>

<p class="Story">Walter was no art
expert, but something wasn&#8217;t right about these paintings. The style and the
subject of the paintings didn&#8217;t seem like his daughter&#8217;s taste. Efavirenz and
saquinavir together definitely wasn&#8217;t right.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Charlie
came back into the living room with full wine glasses talking up their cheese. They saw what Walter was looking at.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh yeah, so about
those paintings&#133;&#148; Marin said. She gave him a weird smile.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;These drugs don&#8217;t
go together,&#148; Walter said, pointing with one index finger at the bottle of
saquinavir then at the bottle of efavirenz.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You can&#8217;t take
these drugs together,&#148; Walter said. &#147;Who painted these?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;An HIV-positive
person,&#148; Charlie said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Then he should know:
you can&#8217;t take these drugs together,&#148; Walter said. &#147;It&#8217;s just not right.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It doesn&#8217;t mean&#133;&#148;
Charlie said to Marin. &#147;I mean, the guy is like ninety pounds. I mean, we
know he&#8217;s really&#133; Weren&#8217;t you there almost every night when Garcia was putting
the altar together?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god,&#148; Marin
said. She sat down on the couch. She looked with wide, frightened eyes at
Walter, and then at Charlie, a flower of realization blooming painfully into
her face. &#147;I think his name is really Mel.&#148;</p>

<div class="sun"><%= image_tag "books/o/ch19.png", alt: "Chapter 19" %></div>
<h2>San Francisco : 2003</h2>
<h3>Ben</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he driveway of
Judith&#8217;s friends&#8217; house was paved with hexagons of pink limestone placed half
an inch from each other in a honeycomb whose edges were now green with alien
planet weeds and chive-like grass. A good third of the hexagon tiles were
cracked, and another third had been pushed up crooked by some root or acute
shift in the surface tension of the earth underneath over the years. The
driveway ran to a garage whose dust-caked windows matched the color of the
acrylic frost letters spray-painted on the giant foam-board train on the
front lawn. The letters on the train spelled: &#147;HAPPY 6TH BIRTHDAY VICK!&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">The
house itself was a Craftsman bungalow with squat stone pillars propping up its
roof, which was missing a few gray shingles. The porch was covered with
crunchy brown leaves and the white-dried plastic parts of a dismantled toy
car. Ben wondered if the jungle where his friend Marin lived these days was
half as wild and weathered.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bessie&#8217;s
grandmother left her this house when she passed away ten years ago,&#148; Judith
said. &#147;Bessie took that as a sign that she should quit her residency and go
back to filmmaking. Elliott was freelance consulting then, so they would go on
these long road trips in Elliott&#8217;s station wagon, filming the desert.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had met and
talked to Elliott and Bessie at prior children-friendly events of Judith&#8217;s med
school circle. Elliott was now a &#147;Nationally Bestselling&#148; author of <i>Lord-of-the-Rings</i>-reference-laden
career advice tomes and charged $12,500 per engagement to summarize his
published philosophies for a live audience. Bessie had finished a general
practice residency at some point, had made partner at her group practice a few
years ago, and now worked three-day weeks. Ben got the sense that Vick saw
both of his parents a lot.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben and Judith had
parked in the street and walked on the crooked pink hexagons towards the house
holding hands. Ben could hear the sugary peals of first graders at play. Was
he really okay with possibly never making/having/raising sugar-voiced munchkins
of his own?</p>

<p class="Story">As if to answer
this unspoken thought, a khaki-pantsed primate cub scampered up the concrete
path at the left side of the house yelling &#147;I AM NOT PRECOOOSIIIS!!!!&#148; It was
followed by its tired-faced, cool-eyed mother. The first grader was wearing a
David Byrne &#147;Look into the Eyeball&#148; T-shirt and the white Y-shaped wire
of a pair of MP3 player earbuds dangled from his ears, the unplugged stereo
jack bouncing against David Byrne&#8217;s silk-screened nasal septum.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith waved <i>hello</i>
to the mother, the wife of a close friend of Judith&#8217;s from med school, as the
woman reached down and grabbed a few square inches of the back of her son&#8217;s
shirt, which, amazingly, stopped and quieted him in one fell swoop. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith and the mom
proceeded to make the small talk of small talk pros. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I am not
precosis,&#148; the boy said to Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, that&#8217;s good,&#148;
Ben said. &#147;Precocious people are the worst.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really?&#148; the boy
said. &#147;Worse than third graders?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, maybe not as
bad as third graders,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The third graders
at my school are really mean to the first graders,&#148; the boy said. &#147;When I&#8217;m in
third grade I&#8217;m going to be nice to the first graders.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did you introduce
yourself to Ben and Judith?&#148; Precosis&#8217;s mom asked him. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But see, if you
start talking to some person already, are&#8217;s you still supposed to introduce?&#148;
the boy asked.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;&#8216;Are you still
supposed to introduce yourself?&#8217;</i>&#148; Precosis&#8217;s mom corrected. &#147;It is rude to
interrupt other people while they are talking, you&#8217;re right. But as soon as
there is a natural pause in the conversation you should still introduce
yourself even if it feels awkward.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">As a teachable
moment to Young Precosis, everyone proceeded to awkwardly introduce themselves
to each other, and the woman, Anne, with mom-given authority, led the three of
them back down the concrete path to Bessie and Elliott&#8217;s garden. </p>

<p class="Story">The music
playing&#151;which Ben did not recognize, and Ben considered himself something of an
audiophile&#151;was not children&#8217;s music. The party&#8217;s adult population seemed to be
composed almost exclusively of reluctant doctors (like Bessie),
famous-on-the-internet types (like Elliott), and stay-at-home parents (like
Anne). The children&#151;ten first-grade boys and four girls, aged two to six&#151;had
taken the giant foam cones, balls, cubes, and loops (meant, Ben supposed, to
inspire the young people&#8217;s dormant stores of creativity) from the giant mesh
basket in the middle of the lawn and had turned them all into weapons with which
they were waging an intense (if rather talky) war with each other.</p>

<p class="Story">Precosis joined the
side of the war that possessed all of the foam cones, MP3 player earbud wires
still dangling from his ears.</p>

<p class="Story">Anne left them by
the yard gate, and joined her husband by the smoking grill. Bessie saw Judith
and Ben come in and came to welcome her new guests. After hugs <i>hello</i>,
Ben gave Bessie the wrapped book of artsy puzzles that they had bought for Vick
(Ben&#8217;s selection: Judith had wanted to give Vick money).</p>

<p class="Story">Bessie took the
gift without looking at it, thanked him and Judith, and said, &#147;Are you guys
thirsty? We have pink lemonade for the kids and adult lemonade for the
adults. Are you hungry? We have hot dogs and well-done hamburgers for the
kids and brats and medium-rare burgers for the adults.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They both asked for
adult lemonade, extra &#147;adult.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Bessie laughed,
rolled her eyes, and said, &#147;I think we may have ran out of &#8216;adult,&#8217; but I&#8217;ll
see what I can do.&#148; She hopped onto the porch, opened the spring-locked screen
door, and went inside, letting the door spring shut behind her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People change so
fast,&#148; Judith said. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben put his arms
around her waist, and Judith laid her cheek against his shoulder. </p>

<p class="Story">Judith had been the
one to bring up the fertility issue during one of their recent couples therapy
sessions. It had been left unresolved, but Judith was adamant about the fact
that, even though she did want to have children in theory, she would not under
any circumstances subject her body and their relationship to <i>in vitro</i>
fertilization, egg donation, or surrogacy. Ben didn&#8217;t want to adopt. He wanted
Judith, but he also wanted his own children. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had actively
lived his life to this date in order to keep himself far from such zero-sum
choices (or so he&#8217;d thought). How had he gotten so far into this
relationship&#151;moved in with a woman&#151;without properly grooming active forks to
major outcomes? Independence ensured choice, and vice versa. However,
choosing an independent individual as a partner apparently did not ensure
independence or choice.</p>

<p class="Story">Elliott came over
with their lemonades. &#147;Hey Judith, Ted,&#148; he said, handing them sweaty tumblers
of sunny liquid with kayaks of ice-maker ice in them. &#147;So Bessie says you guys
moved to Bernal Heights a few weeks ago?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ted was Judith&#8217;s
ex-fianc&#233;. She had met Ted in med school, and they had lived together while
Ted completed his residency and Judith her Ph.D. They had gotten engaged in
1996, before Ted had left for a Doctors without Borders assignment in Haiti. Ted,
shortly after his arrival in the Caribbean, had fallen in love with an
MSF epidemiologist and had broken off his engagement to Judith via voicemail
message. Judith had moved back to the Bay Area later that year and had lived
alone at her place in the Sunset until two months ago when she and Ben had
moved into a two-bedroom in Bernal Heights together.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben,&#148; Judith
said. </p>

<p class="Story">Elliott smacked his
forehead. &#147;Sorry, Ben. Oh my god. It&#8217;s actually, one of Vick&#8217;s best friends
is named Ted, that&#8217;s probably why I&#133; I know Ben. You&#8217;re working for the
design magazine and the art gallery, and your parents run the inn on Martha&#8217;s
Vineyard that Bessie used to stay at when she was little.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;ve just had
too much &#8216;adult,&#8217;&#148; Judith said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;What?&#148;
Elliott said, looking over his shoulder at Vick and the other children. Vick
and Precosis were hitting each other with foam cones. The other children were
standing around them in a ring and hitting them on their backs with other foam
pieces. &#147;Bess! Bess!&#148; Elliott called out to his wife. &#147;I&#8217;m sorry,&#148; he said
to Judith and Ben, and ran down to the yard to enforce an armistice.</p>

<p class="first">After Vick&#8217;s party wrapped up with cake,
singing, and presents a few hours later, Ben and Judith drove back to the city
and had a quiet dinner in the Richmond&#151;Cambodian food&#151;and then walked to Ben&#8217;s
friend Max&#8217;s new place on 18th Avenue for his housewarming party. </p>

<p class="Story">Max was renting a
three-bedroom with two roommates: a video games artist named Pierre (with whom
Max had been living for the past year in Oakland) and a new one. Max had
found both roommates on the internet.</p>

<p class="Story">At nine-oh-five,
Judith and Ben were some of the first guests to arrive. However, both Pierre
and the new roommate Ho had invited their respective &#147;best friends&#148; over for
pre-party preparations, which in the case of Pierre meant a tall, blonde French
girl with pink cheeks named Celeste, and in the case of Ho meant a petite,
bespectacled, be-cardiganed Jewish girl named Rebecca. </p>

<p class="Story">The pre-party
preparations had involved light cleaning, the emptying of one bag of pita chips
and one bag of tortilla chips into bowls, and the setting-out of bottles of
alcohol and tubs of hummus and salsa on a table, so when Judith and Ben arrived
the three boys and two girls were lounging on the two couches in the living
room, at least one of which Ben was certain had come from a city sidewalk. </p>

<p class="Story">Max was slouched
down on the far end of the blue couch with his feet hooked on the edge of the
coffee table, guitar in lap, picking out the opening vamp to <i>Seven Nation
Army</i>. The knotted butt of a spent joint stood straight up in a tiny pile
of its own ashes in a makeshift aluminum foil ashtray next to his feet. Ben
smelled denim brand cologne.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Welcome to the par-tay,
Benjamanno,&#148; Max said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not much of a
par-tay yet,&#148; Ho said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s because all
one hundred people who didn&#8217;t RSVP are going to show up at eleven,&#148; Max said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Or they remembered
how far the Richmond is,&#148; Celeste said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My friends, help
yourself to some toothsome refreshments, my friends,&#148; Max said, strumming a
single G chord lightly.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith opened the
best-looking bottle of red and poured glasses for everyone. They got into a
heated discussion about the new Todd Haynes movie, and more people started
trickling in. Soon enough it was ten-fifteen, and the apartment was packed
with twenty-somethings dressed for much fancier neighborhoods than the
Richmond. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben used to love
Stanford parties. He used to love (truly!) finding out that his Anthro 112
study buddy Paul had gone to high school with that Peter guy that he&#8217;d driven
down to Coachella with. He used to love how diverse the party crowds were in
terms of race, nationality, and sexual orientation and how uniform they were in
terms of age, intelligence, political affiliation, and cultural predilections. He used to love making the rounds and coming upon a debate about a
controversial <i>New York Times</i> article or unexpectedly intriguing NPR
story that he&#8217;d just been having the other day with someone else. </p>

<p class="Story">It wasn&#8217;t just
Judith that had changed things. There was an exciting new torque at work on
all aspects of Ben&#8217;s life as of late. Ever since his MBAD article about the
Sausalito potters had spurred a record sixty-seven letters in response, ever
since one of his favorite Mud23 artists had followed his advice regarding a
major installation detail and mentioned the adjustment (and Ben by name) in an
online interview&#133; Ben had felt impatient with both the anachronistic
traditions of his elders and the scattershot, trial-and-error methods of his
peers. </p>

<p class="Story">Two hours into the
party, Ben went to the bathroom and got separated from Judith.</p>

<p class="Story">Alone, from the
steep vantage of five glasses of wine, Ben breezed through a conversation with
some investment analyst friends of Ho&#8217;s, had Jorge and Maya Reynolds in
stitches with a satiric recounting of Vick&#8217;s birthday party, played devil&#8217;s
advocate with Nazneen in a protracted and pointless argument about the Pure
Homeland attacks, successfully deflected Celeste&#8217;s drunken attentions onto a
grateful Max, and found Judith in a corner talking up her favorite Inner Sunset
places to one of Pierre&#8217;s coworkers and the coworker&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p class="last">Feeling
the warm, soft, inward curve of Judith&#8217;s waist in his hands after what seemed
like a very long time without, Ben whispered in her ear a single syllable:
&#147;Home?&#148; </p>

<p class="first">Judith and Ben walked back to Judith&#8217;s car
along Clement Street at midnight, cold lines of sleet icing their cheeks. The
sky above them was fogged over: gray, matte, a closed door.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I do want
children,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I may have viciously mocked the parents at Vick&#8217;s party
for Jorge&#8217;s amusement tonight, but there&#8217;s something really amazing about it
too: seeing the next generation grow up. Protecting them, pushing them, trying
to guide them.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Judith said,
&#147;and you should have that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But I want to be
with you more than I want that,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">He looked at
Judith: she gave him a face full of brave. She didn&#8217;t need him; she didn&#8217;t
need anyone. And yet, Ben could sense the silent, invisible static cling of
her longing for it to be true. For him to be true.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you sure?&#148; she
said. &#147;Are you sure you don&#8217;t want someone more&#133; eggy?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben laughed. &#147;I&#8217;m
sure,&#148; he said. &#147;You&#8217;re the one I would want to raise children with. You&#8217;re
the one I would want to everything with.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">When she kissed
him, Ben felt the last of his own childhood&#151;all the fear, the confusion, the
waiting for the grownups for this or that&#151;melt away just as surely as the
shaves of ice caught in the twisted wool of Judith&#8217;s gloves melted against the
warmth of his neck.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2005</h2>
<h3>Ben</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">G</span>arcia&#8217;s real name was Mel White. He was a
forty-year-old former architect, let go from his firm during the widespread
industry layoffs in the nineties. After spending seven years painting
Gerard-Richter-style abstracts in his garage without landing even so much as a
group show in Oakland, White had conceived of what he called <i>&#147;my
all-too-successful first attempt at a disruptive performance art piece about
the inherent hypocrisies of the cash-hungry art world.&#148;</i> </p>

<p class="Story">White&#8217;s original
idea had been to simply pose as a young HIV-positive queer man who painted
Gerard-Richter-style abstracts. To this end, White had spent most of 2001
carefully starving himself. (Saltines, Campbell&#8217;s soup with half a can of
water, the occasional Framp Juice smoothie, and multivitamin pills had formed
90% of his diet that year, or so he told <i>Los Angeles Times </i>guest
contributor Honor Lewis in their interview.)</p>

<p class="Story">When Rocco Morris&#8217;s
Venice Biennale exhibit made the cover of <i>ArtForum </i>in 2002, thus opening
up valuable real estate for Bay Area artists in the consciousness of the
commercial art scene for the first time in many years, Gilbert Xavier Garcia
was born. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Harper&#8217;s </i>featured writer
Charlie K. Cohen was given exclusive access to the artist&#8217;s first attempts at
art-making as Gil Garcia: </p>

<div class="newyorker">

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:10pt">For over a decade,
White has used an empty bedroom in his house as storage for past iterations of
his creative output. It is filled with architectural sketches and floorplans,
foamcore and plywood models, and numerous minimalist paintings. White directed
my attention to a triptych of paintings in a clean corner of the room. (The
room, it must be noted, is free of the cobwebs and dust bunnies that plague the
storage spaces of most other households.) White explained that the
paintings&#151;colorful caricatures of Mission Street tacquerias and groceries&#151;were
too &#147;safe, like storybook illustrations,&#148; whereas he sees the Mission School
ethos as &#147;a truly postmodern urban pastoral: a prettyish scene of modern
American community that is always teetering on the edge of something dangerous
or unpleasant.&#148;</p>

<p class="pubs" style="margin-bottom:0">And herein lies the continuing mystery and
madness of the GXG saga: it is difficult to listen to Mel White talk about art
for very long without getting the distinct feeling that you are talking to a
&#147;real&#148; artist.</p>

</div>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">Ben had been in a coffee shop poring over a
series of articles in a contraband copy of <i>The Economist</i> about <i>&#147;systemic
shifts&#148;</i> afoot at the world&#8217;s largest drug companies when Marin called him. Her first questions had all been about the Authorship Warranty on the auctioned
work. He had thought that she was just being annoyingly curious: Marin had the
collecting bug now, after all. It was not until she said the word &#147;hoax&#148; that
Ben realized how completely fucked he was.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben somehow made
the call to Phillip; somehow managed to cook and eat a plate of spaghetti
marinara; pretended to be asleep when Judith got home at eleven; and then, when
she was asleep beside him twenty minutes later, proceeded to stay up the entire
night, his head throbbing with an unfamiliar, dry, squeezing pain.</p>

<p class="Story">The next morning,
Ben got up before his wife and left the house before she emerged from the
shower. He biked into work at seven a.m., the gray morning fog wetting the
rubber and metal brakes in his hand.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben parked his bike
in the hallway nook that he wasn&#8217;t supposed to park his bike in, and
immediately joined a silent Phillip in his office, closing the door even though
no one else was yet in the gallery. Phillip barely nodded at him, hit the
speaker button on the phone, and dialed from memory the number of Mud23&#8217;s
lawyer.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Harris and
Rosenberg, how may I assist you?&#148; a female receptionist said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have a
seven-thirty call with Dan Redwood,&#148; Phillip said. &#147;It&#8217;s Phillip Mudke and Ben
Blakeman from Mud23 Gallery.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hold on just one
moment, Mr. Mudke, let me see if he&#8217;s ready for your call,&#148; the woman said.</p>

<p class="Story">The line went
silent for a moment, and then beeped once.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello Phillip,
it&#8217;s Dan,&#148; said their lawyer, and Ben resented the warm, bearish confidence in
his voice.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I have the
email in front of me,&#148; Dan said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Which email would
that be?&#148; Phillip asked. He bit into an overhanging piece of nail on his left
thumb. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The one that
starts, <i>&#8216;So the jig is up. Yes, my real name is Mel White,&#8217;</i>&#148; Dan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Phillip jerked his
thumb from his mouth and made a fist, wrapping his fingers tightly around
temptation. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Gotcha,&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I also am looking
at a copy of the basic Garcia purchase agreement. Now, the Authorship Warranty
we used is pretty standard. It&#8217;s a limited warranty that covers the original
buyer of record five years from the date of sale. So neither you nor the
seller have any legal obligation to subsequent buyers or even heirs or successors
of the sold paintings, if there are any.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No legal
obligation, just moral, civil, and karmic,&#148; Phillip said. Thumbnail went back
into mouth.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, yes,&#148; Dan
said. &#147;You&#8217;ll need to consult your astrologer on those points. I&#8217;m afraid the
scope of my counsel is limited to the legal. There is also Exclusion (iv) of
the Warranty, which specifically excludes you from liability for works whose <i>&#8216;authorship
on date of sale is consistent with the preponderance of expert and accepted
opinion, despite the later discovery of new information.&#8217;</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sorry, I didn&#8217;t
get much sleep last night,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Can you translate please?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If we can prove
that a majority of art experts considered Gil Garcia to be the author of the
sold paintings on the dates they were sold, then Marin is not obligated to
refund any of the money,&#148; said Phillip.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Of
course, proving that is not simple&#151;there is very little legal precedent for
this situation. Certainly, some proportion of this group of buyers will be
litigious, and they have deep pockets,&#148; Dan said. &#147;I would not advise invoking
Exclusion (iv) in this instance.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">They wrapped up the call ten minutes later
and had two hours of quiet: Ben in his cubicle refreshing his research on the
Garcia buyers, and Phillip in his office either chain-smoking or eating his
entire thumbnail off his thumb. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben&#8217;s coworkers
trickled in, and the news about Garcia&#8217;s true identity spread in shocked
whispers. Ben surprised himself by being able to ignore this mostly, absorb
himself in his research, and then conceive of and articulate to Angela some
small but useful ideas for damage control tactics. Ben fell asleep that night
at eleven&#151;missing Judith for real this time&#151;and got a full ten hours of
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith was gone to
a brunch meeting in the South Bay when Ben woke up at nine a.m. on Saturday,
and he felt refreshed all morning. After a lunch of leftovers at home, he took
the bus to the Mission and sidestepped the usual clumps of cheer-filled
Saturday afternoon foot traffic circling Dolores Park. </p>

<p class="Story">Cheer seemed a
foreign language.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Story">Ben had actually
never been inside Marin&#8217;s apartment before. He and Judith had walked her and
Charlie to the front door two or three times after having dinner with them in the
Mission, but he and Judith had never gone up.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had told Judith
in January that Marin&#8217;s father had lost his job in across the board
post-election cuts at Fenniskrante; Judith&#8217;s response had been unforgettable: <i>&#147;Well,
it&#8217;s good that he has all of those free drugs to medicate away any
unemployment-related anxiety.&#148;</i> </p>

<p class="last">Remembering
his and Judith&#8217;s dinners with the other couple&#151;long three-course meals with
wine and some pretty personal sharing&#151;Ben became infuriated all over again with
his wife&#8217;s lack of empathy towards the unintended victims of her success: Marin
wasn&#8217;t just his friend; she was Judith&#8217;s. Something was just not right with a
person who said things like what she&#8217;d said about her friend&#8217;s father.</p>

<p class="first">Ben rang Marin&#8217;s buzzer, and was let in. A
freckled stone staircase with a black metal railing led up to a very cold
hallway, dimly lit by a narrow and filtered glower of afternoon sunshine. Ben
found Marin&#8217;s apartment door at the far end of it and knocked.</p>

<p class="Story">The door opened,
revealing Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I can&#8217;t get a hold of Charlie.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, but Jorge?&#148;
Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He&#8217;s here,&#148; she
said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, good,&#148; he
said. </p>

<p class="Story">When Ben saw the
look of concerned morbidity that Jorge and Marin exchanged when Ben followed
Marin into her living room&#151;a look that was 100% about Ben&#8217;s appearance&#151;he knew
that he did not look refreshed. When he sat down on Marin&#8217;s couch next to
Jorge and pulled his messenger bag off over his head and shoulder, he
immediately started to shake his right leg. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I haven&#8217;t seen you
in forever Ben,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;Not since the last multimillion-dollar art hoax,
and, hoo boy, that was two months ago already.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ha-ha,&#148; Ben said
instead of laughing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, the great
Ha-Ha, the fifty-year-old woman pretending to be a sixteen-year-old performance
art genius pretending to be a fifty-year-old woman,&#148; Jorge riffed. &#147;The reveal
of Ha-Ha&#8217;s true identity was the greatest shock the international art world had
ever seen&#133; until two months later.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So, what does the
laws say?&#148; Marin asked. She rubbed her eyes with her knuckles.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The laws say&#133;&#148;
Jorge said. &#147;Well, most U.S. intellectual property regulation focuses on
authorship and originality, and Mel White was the original author of all of the
work that Marin bought and all of the work that you sold at the SFMoMA auction. There&#8217;s not really so much a focus on the author&#8217;s credentials. For example,
if someone invents a medical device, and you find out later that he lied on his
resume about having obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard&#151;maybe he really only had a
Master&#8217;s from Ohio State University&#151;he would still be considered the lawful
owner of that intellectual property.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;He just might go
to jail for fraud,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, he probably
wouldn&#8217;t go to jail,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;But if the fake Ph.D. is something he used
to market himself and his company to investors, the investors might be able to
sue him for misleading them.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The problem with
that example is that I presume the device that the man invented has some
objective value that doesn&#8217;t go away simply because he doesn&#8217;t have a Ph.D.
from Harvard,&#148; Ben said. He felt the outer ring of his head start to deaden
again, with that strange, dry pain.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, well
unfortunately IP law is primarily interested in protecting and defining
property that has objective value,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;And that&#8217;s why the Museum&#8217;s
Authorship Warranty ultimately defers to expert opinion. In literature there
is a long history of acceptable use of pen names, particularly women submitting
writing under male pseudonyms in order to get published. It goes to the very
heart of the age-old, unanswerable question, &#8216;What is art?&#8217; Some might argue
that Garcia&#8217;s art is more real than a performance art piece that exists only in
a temporary moment of time, that isn&#8217;t even physical.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s nice to know
that English major Jorge hasn&#8217;t been completely obliterated by law student
Jorge yet,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, it&#8217;s only a
matter of time,&#148; Jorge said. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed
merrily, as if the loss of one&#8217;s idealism and intellectual integrity on a fixed
schedule was a consummately executed absurdist pun. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, how are you
so calm?&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because if I
wasn&#8217;t, <i>Ben</i>,&#148; Marin said his name as if even its authenticity was not a
sure thing anymore, &#147;I would be seriously freaking out right now.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So freak out,&#148; Ben
said. &#147;I am.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you honestly
think I&#8217;m not phased about the fact that I threw away my career in international development&#151;<i>again</i>&#151;for
whatever this is?&#148; Marin said. &#147;Or do you think I&#8217;m just really zen about the
fact that I haven&#8217;t been able to get a hold of my boyfriend of eight months
since I heard the name &#8216;Mel White?&#8217; Charlie&#8217;s fucking going to try to get a
by-line out of this, I know he is. <i>Fucking writer.</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge reached over
and rubbed Marin on the back.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, Marin, shit,
I&#8217;m sorry,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I had no idea. You really think Charlie would do
that?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Charlie loves Charlie&#151;a lot,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I knew that from our first date. I still hoped
that, when the stakes were high enough&#133; Well, he made his choice.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The choice of a
buttmunch,&#148; said Jorge.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben and Marin
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">Judith certainly
compared favorably to Charlie. She had earned her righteousness. All those
stories about drug companies selectively publishing trial results to make their
drugs look more effective and less harmful: that wasn&#8217;t just political
rhetoric, that was real. Judith had taken on a powerful, amoral industry and won. So she had done it by exploiting the fears and faith of low-income, rural
communities. All&#8217;s fair&#133; right?</p>

<p class="Story">And yet, maybe it
was a difference in generation here, a difference in growing up with Clintonian
triangulation instead of Reaganist hypocrisy-with-a-smile, but Ben still felt
disturbed by the brutality of his wife&#8217;s actions and thinking. He had looked
through the over eight-hundred photos from their wedding on PicView in search
of some actionable evidence of a concrete betrayal of him by Judith: something
that would justify the mix of shallow contempt and disappointment that he&#8217;d
felt towards her since election day. Finding nothing had not given him
closure.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben was just being
childish, wasn&#8217;t he? Hadn&#8217;t he been looking down on his unmarried friends&#151;basically
all of his friends his own age&#151;for months now? Snubbed their indulgent
standards, their &#147;need&#148; to date or marry people who were this or that thing
that didn&#8217;t exist? He&#8217;d wanted to grow up, so he <i>needed to grow up. </i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, thanks,
Jorge, this was really helpful,&#148; said Marin. &#147;My choice is clear: I&#8217;ve got to
buy everything back.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But then you might
end up with nothing,&#148; said Jorge. &#147;Who knows what Mel White did with your
money. And the gallery&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, the gallery
has to keep its fee,&#148; said Marin. &#147;I mean, Ben and I have been in this
together since the beginning. I&#8217;m not like Charlie. I couldn&#8217;t damage your
relationship with Phillip even more than I already have.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But Marin,&#148; said
Ben, &#147;I was the one who found Garcia.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wanted him to be
real just as much as you,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Anyway, it&#8217;s my money. Job trumps
money.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you quit your
job for Garcia,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I quit a job that
I hated when I no longer had a reason not to,&#148; said Marin. &#147;Garcia, Mel White,
just quickened the inevitable.&#148; She looked at the wall above and behind Ben,
on which, Ben realized only now, hung the two un-auctioned GXG paintings. </p>

<p class="Story">The room was quiet
for a long few seconds.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben looked behind
himself again, at the painting hanging over his head. This would have been one
of the paintings that he&#8217;d have kept, too. He had always loved the way that
&#147;Garcia&#148; had painted the purple ears of corn in the field in the painting&#8217;s
foreground: the violet-red highlights where the sun hit the individual grains,
the wrinkled black and blue leaves. It didn&#8217;t seem possible, still, that the
person that Ben had thought had painted this was all an illusion. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Does anyone else
want water?&#148; Ben asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Jorge and Marin
nodded noncommittally.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0.25in;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24.0pt">Ben
stood up and went into Marin&#8217;s kitchen. Orange sunlight soaked the softened
skins of ripe nectarines in a large purple bowl on the kitchen table. On the
very edge of the table, quarantined forebodingly, a balled-up pair of men&#8217;s
socks sat atop a used paperback copy of <i>A Wind-Up Bird Chronicle </i>that
Marin had borrowed from Charlie. On the opposite end of the table, just in the
shadow of the nectarine bowl, was a printed presentation deck. The title page
read:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b><u>The New Normal:</u></b></p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin:0"><b>A Comprehensive Post-66A</b></p>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24pt;font-size:90%"><b><i>GlaxoSmithKline, March 2005</i></b></p>

<p class="Story">Ben immediately
turned away from the table and opened the doors of Marin&#8217;s cabinets one-by-one
in quick succession, not remembering that he was looking for water glasses
until he&#8217;d closed the door of the cabinet containing mugs and glasses. He
opened it again and took out three glasses. He turned on the water in the sink
and filled the glasses with it, getting everything within a six-inch perimeter
of the sink wet in the process. Holding the glasses together in a triangular
grip with both hands, he brought all three to the living room at once. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin was kneeling
on the couch where Ben had been sitting. She was holding the Garcia
cornfield-and-drug-bottle painting by both of its vertical sides, taking its
weight off the nail in the wall. She slid to the floor with it and set it down
on the ground in front of the other, already-removed painting, which was
leaning against the base of the couch. Ben put the triad of tap water on the
coffee table and stood uncertainly, running his fingers through his hair. He
felt warm.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are you going
to put there?&#148; Jorge asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin sat in the
armchair by the window, crossed her legs, placed her arms queenly on the
chair&#8217;s armrests, and looked at the blank wall. </p>

<p class="last">&#147;I
don&#8217;t know,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="first">Ben came home to the familiar sight and
sound of Judith cleaning to public radio. A novelist was being interviewed
about his spare, powerful prose style. The novelist began reading an excerpt
from his spare and powerful post-apocalyptic novel.</p>

<p class="Story">Hey how was brunch?
the husband said. He closed the door behind himself. The latch clicked. The
city, outside.</p>

<p class="Story">The wife had a
broom in one hand and a plastic pan of dust and sheddings in the other. She
stepped on the pedal of the trashcan and opened its lid. She banged the pan
side against the cans lip. The gray and black clouds of waste slid out of
sight.</p>

<p class="Story">Hey babe, she
said. It was okay. She yawned. We had crepes at this new place in downtown
San Jose. Harriets thinking about leaving her job to start her own org. Whereve you been? Wooing some topsecret client to the gallery? I havent seen
you in three days.</p>

<p class="Story">He told her about
the Mistake. The Great Fake. </p>

<p class="Story">She washed her
hands quickly and turned off the radio. She asked him How When Why WhatNext. She seemed to understand everything immediately, as always. Everything except
that he had betrayed her. The husbands silence about what hed seen in that
other kitchen, earlier, betrayed the wife even now. </p>

<p class="Story">She said, How could
you have known? </p>

<p class="Story">She said, They cant
blame you.</p>

<p class="Story">She said, We can
get through this. </p>

<p class="Story">He said, I know.</p>

<p class="Story">They came together
then and held each other. Her body could have been anyones. The change in
him, so sudden&#151;and so unlike him&#151;could not be undone. His name was Apostate
now and no search for faith could bring him to god again.</p>

<p class="Story">The wife turned the
radio on again and continued cleaning. </p>

<p class="Story">The husband
remembered the full hamper in the bedroom closet and said, I think Ill do some
laundry.</p>

<p class="Story">He dug his arms
into the bin of stalesmelling fabrics, pulled and dropped a pile of clothes
onto the floor. He sorted them with one hand&#151;lights on the right, darks on the
left. He looked at a dark gray pair of yoga pants (hers) for a long time
before putting it on the left pile.</p>

<p class="Story">Dinner was pasta
and clamsauce, his favorite asachild. The husbands mother had given the wife
the recipe on their first trip to his hometown after their engagement. The
smell of the clamshells wine herbs and cream steaming together on the stove. Clam season on the island.</p>

<p class="Story">As he Went inside
her that night he felt the usual bliss and a new emptiness. He turned over
onto cool bedsheets the color of a scaled fish. </p>

<p class="Story">He remembered
shopping for bedsheets. Hot outside, over eighty. Wearing shorts, wanting
icecream, theyd argued about colors threadcount and price, both teasing the
other for not being able to decide on a simple thing as bedsheets.</p>

<p class="Story">So is Mel White
even gay? the wife asked.</p>

<p class="Story">I cant remember
anymore, the husband said. I think we might have confirmed not, but I honestly
cant remember.</p>

<p class="Story">Sunday was eggs
coffee newspaper emails slicepizza parkrun sushiwithfriends rentedmovie sleep.</p>

<p class="Story">Work was some but
small comfort. The husband hated the offices smell of wetpaint and
spicedbeans. Hated being interrupted. Hated being ignored. Sometimes he went
to the bathroom to the furthest stall and sat, notcertain he would be able to
go out again.</p>

<p class="Story">On his bike during
his commute and semiweekly longdistance ride afterwork the husband made risky
turns and speed changes. He almost crashed one morning and another night. Each time he vowed after to be more careful but the ability seemed gone from
him. Taken. A kidnapped child.</p>

<p class="Story">Friday everyone
else hurried through their work. They could not wait for their two days away
from the demanding the rich the crazy. The husband knew that the wife had
questions to ask him. The husband was not ready to answer her questions. </p>

<p class="last">The
husband received an automated message from an invitation website. His former
coworkers housewarming party. Tonight. Eightaclock. He had not planned on
attending and had forgotten it.</p>

<p class="first">Billy Earhardt and Honor Lewis had bought a
two-bedroom condo in Hayes Valley in March, moving in together a few weeks
ago. Ben hadn&#8217;t seen Billy since his and Judith&#8217;s wedding. Ben had last <i>seen</i>
Honor at the SFMoMA auction, but they hadn&#8217;t spoken. Even if Ben had been in
regular contact with Billy and Honor, he was in no state to arrive first at
their party. </p>

<p class="Story">After being the
last one to leave Mud23, at five-forty, Ben biked out to Japantown and
parked his bike in the mall garage. He wasn&#8217;t hungry yet so he didn&#8217;t go
inside the mall. He started walking without a destination and felt and
followed the gravitational pull of Fillmore Street. </p>

<p class="Story">He walked north on Fillmore all the
way to Washington Street and then was suddenly ravenous. He reversed
course, and, under more careful scrutiny, the numerous food establishments that
he&#8217;d passed on the way up revealed themselves as not-viable dinner options. Several were too fancy to eat alone at, some too crowded, some too empty,
several had closed in just the past thirty minutes. He entered the red zone of
his hunger when he was still seven blocks from Japantown. If he didn&#8217;t eat now
he would feel sick all night, and he couldn&#8217;t afford that kind of physical
discomfort right now. </p>

<p class="Story">The only open
restaurants within a two-block radius of his current coordinates were a
$16-a-plate tapas place and the Szechwan Boat, a standalone outlet of the
national food court chain. Szechwan Boat it would have to be. </p>

<p class="Story">Inside the Szechwan
Boat, a tall man dressed like Eponine from the musical version of <i>Les
Miserables</i> sat under bright white light eating chow mein and sweet-and-sour
something from a styrofoam plate. Ben approached the glassed-in steam table
and surveyed his options. Some of the metal trays in the buffet had been
removed, revealing the not-so-steaming pool of water underneath. Broccoli
florets, wilted, browned, and bleached from too much slow steaming, sat in a shallow
pool of beer-colored water. Three soggy pork nuggets and a square-inch of
onion in a thick pool of bright red jelly was all that was left of the
sweet-and-sour pork. The pepper beef looked surprisingly fresh, however, with
squares of red pepper that were still red and squares of green pepper that were still green sticking out from a black-flecked black sauce along with fat fingers of steak. Ben caught the attention of the Asian woman with penciled-in eyebrows mopping
the floor behind the counter and ordered a pepper beef and white rice. It came
with a self-serve fountain soda and an individually-wrapped fortune cookie.</p>

<p class="last">Ben
filled the waxy inside of his soda cup halfway with diet cola and sat at the
cleanest-looking table. As hungry as he was, his food did not taste good&#151;the
beef was very tough and the sauce all salt and starch&#151;but it went down easy
enough. He sipped at his soda and removed the wrapper from his fortune
cookie. He cracked the cookie&#8217;s wings apart and pulled out the slip of white
paper sticking out of the left wing. It read:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:center;font-size:82%;text-indent:0"><b>Adversity reveals genius, prosperity conceals it.</b></p>

<p class="Story">Ben knew that it
wasn&#8217;t a good sign that the dots of the i&#8217;s in the sentence seemed to be
transmitting a hidden message that he couldn&#8217;t decipher. He ate the cookie and
let the paper fortune fall into a black pool of beef sauce on his plate. He
deposited his used plate, fork, and other trash in the trash bin inside the
soy-sauce-streaked box near the door and returned to Fillmore Street.</p>

<p class="last">He
continued down to Japantown, went to the bathroom in the mall, and then found
his bike. It was now eight-thirty. If he could have afforded a hotel room, he
might have checked into a room at the Miyako Hotel, taken a hot bath, put on a
robe, and watched premium cable all night in a king bed, but Ben really, really
could not afford a hotel room. So Ben double-checked his printed map and directions to Billy
and Honor&#8217;s place and unlocked his bike.</p>

<p class="first">Billy and Honor&#8217;s building was four
stories, with a simple charcoal-gray stucco exterior, the top three with large
mangaris wood and pre-cast concrete balconies jutting out from the right side. Party guests carrying beer bottles and punch-like cocktails in drinking jars
chattered and laughed on the highest balcony. As Ben buzzed Apartment #4, an
inflated plastic palm tree was tossed over the side of the balcony to the
walled-in garden on the first floor. There was a loud female scold, &#147;<i>Carl!</i>,&#148;
and Ben was buzzed in. </p>

<p class="Story">He climbed the
stairs past the closed doors of quiet apartments flanked by small,
expensive-looking oriental plants and high-end pet and camping gear. The door
on the fourth floor was open, and Ben went in. A small vestibule with a
built-in bookshelf filled with travel photos opened onto a large living space
that itself opened on the left onto a large and gorgeous blue-and-gold kitchen
and on the right to the balcony that Ben had seen from the street.</p>

<p class="Story">The apartment was filled with people who seemed to have been transported from six months in the future. They were dressed strangely: it was the curated strangeness of high
fashion, but minus any attempt at sensuality.</p>

<p class="Story">It had not yet been two years since Max,
Ho, and Pierre&#8217;s housewarming party in the Richmond, but clearly something was
different in the state of young people in San Francisco. </p>

<p class="Story">Where had Ben been
that he&#8217;d missed out on this transformation until now? </p>

<p class="Story">Oh yeah, married.</p>

<p class="Story">Honor and Billy
appeared in Ben&#8217;s sightline. They were both at peak cocktail-induced happiness
levels that would be paid for at a much later time when Ben would no longer be
in their company, so Ben felt lucky about his timing at least. </p>

<p class="Story">Honor was wearing a
toy tiara that had silver plastic letters glued to it that spelled &#147;TROLL
QUEEN.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">They did their
host-guest routine, and then Billy said, &#147;People are a leetle bit more drunk
than usual because editorial told staff today that we&#8217;re shutting down print
operations in August.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;MBAD&#8217;s shutting
down?&#148; Ben said. This was news to him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Shutting down <i>print
</i>operations,&#148; Billy said. &#147;We&#8217;re untethering ourselves from our Gutenberg
past and blasting off into the future!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s the only
thing that makes sense,&#148; Honor said. &#147;If you could see the numbers some of
these blogs are doing&#151;working alone, at home, by accident even&#133; With our
connections, brand equity, and publishing and editorial experience, all we need
to do is to invest in the technology and resell our advertisers, and our
ability to scale goes up, what two, three orders of magnitude?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Online or bust,&#148;
Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Change is good,&#148;
said Billy. &#147;But still scary.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s what I was
talking to Shell about in the kitchen,&#148; Honor said. &#147;She said that a big part
of any web venture today is still educating people&#151;employees and customers
both&#151;about why it makes sense to change even if it seems like the current
system isn&#8217;t broken. You can&#8217;t just assume that people are as excited about
the possibilities of technology as you are.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People don&#8217;t
realize,&#148; Billy said. &#147;I mean, I didn&#8217;t even realize until we started
discussing the transition at MBAD&#151;how far into the future people like Honor and
our web architect Luke are thinking about and planning for all of these
issues. All of those Luddite questions that us BFAs have about what this means
for community, dialogue, authenticity, credibility, craft, quality control&#133;
Honor and Luke have really thoughtful, serious answers to all of these
questions, and about a million other questions the rest of us haven&#8217;t thought
of yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Speaking of
authenticity,&#148; Honor said. She smacked the air on its cheek. &#147;I must be
really drunk&#151;I almost forgot.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You heard,&#148; Ben
said. Of course, she&#8217;d heard about Garcia already. She&#8217;d been at the
auction. The San Francisco art community was a very small world.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your Mexican
street kid is a middle-aged white dude, and here we are blathering about the
amazing future that is online publishing,&#148; Honor said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sorry, Ben,&#148; said
Billy. &#147;He sure had me fooled.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So anyway, I guess
the<i> L.A. Times </i>saw my item about the auction in MBAD,&#148; Honor said, &#147;and
they approached me about doing a profile on Mel White. I haven&#8217;t gotten back
to them yet. Would you be okay with that?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had already
felt uncomfortable with much of this conversation because the Honor Lewis
speaking to him did not square in profound and basic ways with the Honor Lewis
that he thought he knew and loathed. Now here she was extending this
devastating courtesy that Ben probably did not deserve. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think I need a
drink,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, yes!&#148; said
Ben&#8217;s hosts. &#147;Drink on it! Sleep on it!&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">They led him to the
liquor table, where Billy had one of his bandmates make Ben a manhattan with
three cherries in a converted mason jar.</p>

<p class="Story">They left him
alone in the kitchen with what Ben&#8217;s peripheral vision told him were eight
Valencia Street power lesbians dancing to the Franz Ferdinand song that was
playing and hugging each other.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben sipped at his
drink, feeling oddly shy. He tasted shockingly good bourbon.</p>

<p class="Story">One of the lesbians
waved at someone behind him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben!&#148; the girl
shouted. She waved once again more slowly: <i>hello?</i></p>

<p class="Story">It was Shelly
Yang. With Billy Earhardt&#8217;s haircut. She came over to Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I haven&#8217;t seen you
in, like, three years,&#148; Shelly said. &#147;Since a few months after graduation. How&#8217;ve you been?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">An impossible
question. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Busy,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Naz said you got
married?&#148; Shelly said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Last September.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s really
cool,&#148; Shelly said. &#147;I was seeing someone pretty seriously, a former employee
actually. We broke up last week, though. She wants to settle down and have
kids. She&#8217;s a few years older so she&#8217;s very conscious about the biological
clock and everything. I&#8217;m like, look, I <i>just </i>came out of the closet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I actually hadn&#8217;t
even heard that you had been and were now out of the closet,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really?&#148; Shelly
said. She seemed surprised. &#147;Yeah, I came out on my blog in January. It was
kind of a big deal.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you know Honor
and Billy,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes!&#148; she said. &#147;My friend Luke is working with them on the MBAD website redesign. But we also
all met at our friend Alice&#8217;s birthday party in Tahoe last year. Do you know
Alice Cheung? Stanford &#8217;99? Works at Sequoia? Oh, <i>ha-ha</i>, I spy a
hungry Nazneen Abadi at twelve o&#8217;clock.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A famished Nazneen
Abadi,&#148; Nazneen said, coming over. &#147;Hey, Ben.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen was
drinking a pink cocktail in which floated a stack of thin round slices of
grapefruit and lemon.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, is
Nazneen Abadi drinking citrus?&#148; Ben asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Shelly&#8217;s not the
only one who&#8217;s made big changes in her life,&#148; Nazneen said, smiling and putting
her arm around Shelly&#8217;s waist.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess not,&#148; said
Ben. He was genuinely as disoriented by this revelation as the revelation that
Shelly was gay.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The things we do
for love,&#148; Shelly said. &#147;Facing the eternal wrath of our Christian parents,
eating rinded fruit.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did I start eating
citrus because of Rick?&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;I guess I did. Because of Emma. When
you eat and drink with a kid, you can&#8217;t be too picky.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Shelly looked at
Ben and looked at Nazneen. &#147;I think I&#8217;m going to head out, kiddoes.&#148; She
removed her waist from Nazneen&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; said
Nazneen. She gave Shelly two one-handed-clap waves. &#147;See you at Gaurav and
Nancy&#8217;s engagement in two weeks.&#148; They hugged goodbye.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye Ben, it was
nice to see you,&#148; Shelly said. She waved at him shyly and walked out into the
living room. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where&#8217;s Judith?&#148;
Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Home with the
flu,&#148; Ben lied. &#147;I probably should go home soon and be a good husband. I just
hadn&#8217;t seen Honor and Billy in awhile.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh that&#8217;s right,
you used to work with them,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;I think of Honor as Shelly&#8217;s
friend.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Rick and Emma?&#148;
Ben said. &#147;Dare I ask?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, yeah,&#148; Nazneen
said. Her face visibly changed seasons, from the spring of party small talk to
the autumn of introspective musing. &#147;They&#8217;re old news. Rick is this divorced
guy I started dating not long after your wedding. We broke up a few weeks
ago. He has a three-year-old daughter, Emma. We were pretty serious. I mean,
I would take Emma to the playground by myself sometimes. I helped tuck her
into bed and read her her books every other night. The break-up was friendly. We&#8217;re just on different journeys right now. I&#8217;m having to travel a lot now for
my job, and that doesn&#8217;t really make for a stabilizing home environment for a
kid whose biological parents are divorced.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah,&#148; Ben said. For the first time since their break-up six years ago, Ben was becoming aware
of his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s sensory-pleasing womanliness: the softness of the skin
around her jaw; the way her curves expanded the knitted ribs of the mustard
yellow tanktop that she was wearing; the fatty shampoo musk of her hair, which
she&#8217;d grown out to her back.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I met Marin for
drinks last night,&#148; Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh yeah?&#148; Ben
said. So Nazneen knew too. &#147;Is she doing okay?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, she&#8217;s fine,&#148;
Nazneen said and laughed. &#147;You know Marin. That girl never met a shitstorm
she couldn&#8217;t find her way out of, with a bunch of daisies in her back pocket. <i>She&#8217;s</i>
worried about <i>you</i>. This Garcia thing is pretty bad, eh?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s not just
Garcia,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">If anyone would
have understood Ben&#8217;s strange need to protect Dr. Choo, it would be Nazneen,
Marin Choo&#8217;s number-one fan. Marin could do no wrong in Nazneen&#8217;s eyes. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve felt pretty
guilty about this Prop 66A stuff, after I heard Marin&#8217;s dad lost his job right
after the election,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, retired
early. Same diff, I guess,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;But he has an even better gig
lined up now, here, near Marin! Hopefully it comes through. I get that,
though. The conflicting loyalties. Does Marin know you feel that way?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I haven&#8217;t said
anything,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Does Judith know
you feel that way?&#148; Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Kind of,&#148; Ben
said. &#147;I&#8217;ve hinted at it. But&#151;this is the worst thing. A week ago, at
Marin&#8217;s place, when I was over to talk about Garcia, I saw Dr. Choo&#8217;s
PowerPoint deck for his recent presentation at a big drug company out here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen was
listening raptly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And I didn&#8217;t, I
couldn&#8217;t, tell Judith,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I&#8217;ve been protecting a Republican&#151;<i>from
my wife</i>. That&#8217;s pretty fucked up.&#148; He finished his drink.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Judith isn&#8217;t sick
tonight, is she?&#148; Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">The fast dance song
that had been playing ended, and a slow indie rock power ballad started. It
was a waltz. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s amazing how
quickly things end once they&#8217;re over,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, that&#8217;s how
it was with Rick and I,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;One day, we were making dinner
together every night, going to the park: a family. But then one day Emma came
home from school and decided that she wanted to call me &#8216;Mom.&#8217; And I just
could not. Be called. &#8216;Mom.&#8217; I&#8217;m twenty-four years old! Things unraveled
really quickly after that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben nodded. His
and Nazneen&#8217;s situations were not at all similar, but Ben was in no position to
be choosy.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you,&#148; Nazneen
looked around, making sure the kitchen was still empty. She continued softly,
barely vocalizing the words: &#147;separating, then?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Ben said,
needed to say. He added quickly, &#147;but this is not public information.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen mimed
zipping her lips and throwing away the key.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben felt really
stupid. Nazneen could not keep a secret. In fact, she was the absolute worst
person he could have told any secret to, let alone the fact that he and Judith
were having possible terminal marital difficulties.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think we both
need shots,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I thought you were
&#8216;famished,&#8217;&#148; Ben said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Shots got
calories,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;Lotsa calories.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">She nudged Ben
towards the drinks table like the wayward beef cow that he was. Nazneen looked
at the assembled bottles for a minute, considering her options. She plucked a
bottle of J&#228;germeister from the middle of the crowded back of the table and
placed it in the middle of the cleared front triumphantly, as if the bottle&#8217;s
new position was checkmate. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;One shot,&#148; Ben
said. &#147;I&#8217;m not at the denial stage of things yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you talking
K&#252;bler-Ross?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bad joke,&#148; said
Ben. &#147;Sorry.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll give you
K&#252;bler-Ross,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;Let&#8217;s see, we&#8217;ve got&#133;&#148; She pulled out a bottle
of vodka and said, &#147;Denial?&#148; Another bottle, tequila: &#147;Anger?&#148; Whiskey:
&#147;Bargaining?&#148; Rum: &#147;Depression?&#148; Red wine: &#147;Acceptance.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cute,&#148; said Ben. &#147;Very cute.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I try,&#148; said
Nazneen. &#147;So what&#8217;ll you have, sir?&#148; She did her best game show vamp to the
row of six bottles.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Water?&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen looked
disappointed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Shot of J&#228;ger,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen poured
two. They cheered their glasses and took them back.</p>

<p class="Story">A man wearing a
striped scarf and Buddy Holly glasses appeared at the kitchen counter and
looked Ben up and down.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nazbunny, did you
just do a shot of J&#228;ger?&#148; the man said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey, shots keep a
girl young,&#148; Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You can take the
girl out of Pi Phi, but you can&#8217;t take the Pi Phi out of the girl,&#148; the man
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ben, this is Link
Mueller,&#148; said Nazneen. &#147;Link just left Apple to start his own company. Link,
this is my college freshman-year boyfriend Ben. He&#8217;s a curator at Mud23
Gallery.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your
college-freshman-age boyfriend Ben?&#148; Link said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Gross!&#148; Nazneen
said. &#147;Be nice or go away.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Very nice to meet
you Ben,&#148; Link said. &#147;And congratulations on surviving dating <i>this one</i>
in one piece.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Honor and Billy
came in from the balcony then, leading a large troop of party guests in search
of provisions, both liquid and solid. Twenty minutes later, Ben realized that
this was the real party just begun. Over the next three hours, Ben found
himself in a continuous stream of conversations, exclusively with very smart,
engaging people that he didn&#8217;t know. Billy came over approximately every
thirty minutes and exchanged Ben&#8217;s empty mason jar for a mason jar with a
delicious new cocktail experiment in it. Honor came over after the third
cocktail round and made Ben and the person he was talking to each eat one of the
homemade buttermilk biscuits she had just taken out of the oven. They were
buttery, soft, and warm.</p>

<p class="Story">At just after one
a.m., Ben looked for and found Nazneen on the balcony talking to a lesbian
couple that he had met earlier in the evening: Yael and Jan. Yael and Jan were
huddled together under a blanket on an adirondack chair. Nazneen was leaned
back against the wood slats of the balcony railing. The night breeze blew once
through her hair.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you still
living in Pacific Heights?&#148; Ben asked Nazneen.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Same place,&#148;
Nazneen said. &#147;I walked here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can I crash on
your couch tonight?&#148; Ben asked. &#147;I&#8217;m in no shape to bike to Bernal
right now. I&#8217;ll probably just sleep it off and bike home early this morning,
so I won&#8217;t impose on your Saturday at all.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know Ben,&#148;
Nazneen said. &#147;If you weren&#8217;t an ex...&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, it would be
weird, you&#8217;re right,&#148; Ben said. &#147;I can call a cab and come back for my bike
tomorrow.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, it&#8217;s fine,&#148;
Nazneen said. &#147;You&#8217;re married or whatever you are. You and me were so long
ago. It&#8217;s fine.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can I park my bike
inside your apartment?&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="last">Nazneen
closed her eyes for a few long seconds. She opened them, smiling her trademark
buddha&#8217;s smile of old. &#147;Don&#8217;t push it, buddy,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="first">Nazneen and Ben said their goodbyes to
Billy, Honor, and the remaining party guests and then walked back to the ground
floor and into the deathly quiet San Francisco night together.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben had initially
hoped that during their walk he could say something to contain the damage done
by their brief talk about Judith earlier. However, Nazneen never brought it
up, and Ben hoped that that meant that she&#8217;d known that he hadn&#8217;t meant that a
divorce was imminent or even going to happen at all. She <i>had </i>categorized
him as &#147;married&#148; just now. Regardless of how much real damage had been done,
everything he thought of to say would have only made it worse. </p>

<p class="Story">Instead, he and
Nazneen mostly talked more about Rick and Emma. What Rick allowed Emma to stay
up past eleven o&#8217;clock for. The time Rick and Emma had made brunch for Nazneen
and burnt the scones. Rick&#8217;s rules for dating as a single dad, and how he had broken
all but one of them for Nazneen. The difficulty Nazneen had had with not
cursing around Emma.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I didn&#8217;t think I
curse a lot, but apparently I do,&#148; Nazneen said, stopping in front of a white
building with bay windows and a gated stoop. She looked in her purse for her
keys.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Don&#8217;t you mean, &#8216;I
apparently curse a fucking shit-ton?&#8217;&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, fucking
cocksucker thinks I curse too fucking much, what&#8217;s his ever-bleeding damage?&#148;
Nazneen said. She pulled out her keys.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That last one was
weird,&#148; Ben said, trying not to smile at her expense.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;See, now I get
confused! I&#8217;m so used to trying to censor myself&#133;&#148; Nazneen started laughing. &#147;Now I can&#8217;t even curse properly!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it&#8217;s the
thought that counts in swearing,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess,&#148; Nazneen
said. She opened the gate.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben rolled his bike
slowly up to the stoop, stopping when his front tire bumped against the lowest
step. He rolled it back an inch and then into the step again a few times as he
said, &#147;Bike can haz sleepy Naz house?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Seriously?&#148;
Nazneen said. &#147;You really can&#8217;t park it on the sidewalk?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There is a 98%
chance it&#8217;ll get stolen if I do,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen growled. &#147;You so owe me.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;I do,
I do, I really do,&#148; said Ben.</p>

<p class="first">Nazneen had the standard upwardly-mobile
single twenty-something living room setup: flatscreen TV; DVD player; DVR
console; MP3 player dock; couch; armchair; modular cube bookshelves filled with
the usual collection of middlebrow novels, essay collections, and travel
guides; and desk in the corner with sleeping desktop computer and charging
laptop computer. There were signs that the frequent work travel that she had
mentioned had not just been talk. A framed Toulouse Lautrec poster was propped
up against one wall, on the floor. There was a green drawstring laundry bag on
the sofa, full of clothes. Two open, halfway packed or unpacked black rolling
carry-on bags sat side-by-side at the foot of the sofa. On the coffee
table was a vase of dead sunflowers and five remote controls. </p>

<p class="Story">Nazneen switched on
a small desk lamp, and then grabbed the laundry bag by the loose ring of fabric
at its top. She placed it on the floor beside the sofa. She quickly zipped
closed the two suitcases, stood them up, and rolled them off to the side next
to the laundry bag. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So there&#8217;s the
couch, I guess,&#148; Nazneen said. &#147;You don&#8217;t need anything else, right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ben didn&#8217;t want her
to leave him. As long as he was with her he felt safe, still a guest at Honor Lewis and Billy Earheardt&#146;s housewarming party. He took
off his jacket and draped it on the arm of the couch. He walked over to
Nazneen and wiped the hair from her face. He kissed her on the mouth. She
kissed him back and put her hands in his hair. Her chest squeezed into his in
the process, and Ben was conscious of kissing a woman of a different height and
proportion than his wife. </p>

<p class="Story">Maybe Ben had been
innocent until two minutes ago; maybe the whole night had been one long tease. He reached down and picked Nazneen up under her hips. She squealed with
surprise. He carried her into the bedroom and threw her crossways,
backside-down onto the bed. She squealed again.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, this is
too weird,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You started it,&#148;
Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>You</i> kissed <i>me</i>,&#148;
Nazneen said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You started it with
the shots,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="last">Nazneen
sat up halfway and kissed him, her tongue moving in and out of his mouth
artfully, slowly. She reached under his shirt to his shoulder and brushed her
nails down his chest and his soft, right side. &#147;You can leave any time,&#148; she
purred.</p>

<p class="first">Ben woke up at noon the next day, alone in
Nazneen&#8217;s bed with four hours of sunshine. He smelled browning butter and
sugar and eggs. Pancakes. He was such a bastard.</p>

<p class="Story">He put his clothes
on and rubbed the dead muscles of his face awake with his palms. He stole a
quick peek at himself in the vanity mirror on Nazneen&#8217;s dresser. His
reflection&#151;young, healthy, All-American&#151;induced in him the same repulsed reflex
as the face of the most alien and inhuman of state enemies.</p>

<p class="Story">Ben reached in his
back pocket and found his phone, opening it for the first time since he had put
it on silent mode when he&#8217;d left work on Friday. Nothing. No missed calls, no
texts. Judith apparently did not think that he had been kidnapped or run over
by a truck. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Entropy, Harriet,
entropy,&#148;</i>
Mel-White-as-Garcia had said to Marin once. </p>

<p class="Story">Ben had thought
that the artist was either insane or full of shit at the time, but now Ben
understood him perfectly.</p>

<h2>Sarawak : 2004</h2>
<h3>Will</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he leader of Pure Homeland, Abdul Sayid Al-Abdullah,
had gotten his undergraduate degree at the University of Florida-Gainesville,
returning to his hometown of Jakarta upon his graduation in 1999. </p>

<p class="Story">Al-Abdullah&#8217;s
roommate during his first year at Gainesville was a man named Chris Avery. Avery was now a real estate developer in Tampa. To his many interviewers,
Avery described Al-Abdullah as quiet, polite, and cerebral. Avery said that he
and Al-Abdullah had mostly stayed out of each other&#8217;s way. Avery, a vegan in
college, said that his and Al-Abdullah&#8217;s one, and ongoing, conflict had been
about whether or not Al-Abdullah could keep the turkey cold cuts that he ate
nearly every day for lunch, in simple sandwiches with butter and white bread,
in their dorm room refrigerator.</p>

<p class="Story">Stephanie Walczek,
in her eight-page profile of Orang-Utan Rehabilitation Center director Wan
Mohammed in <i>The New Yorker</i>, &#147;The Orientation Director,&#148; poked fun at
those in her cohort who would extrapolate directly from the eighteen-year-old
Al-Abdullah&#8217;s love of turkey cold cuts to his subsequent brutalities toward
other, even higher, vertebrates: </p>

<div class="newyorker">

<p class="pubs" style="margin:0">At the suggestion
that Pure Homeland&#8217;s decision to attack three Borneo orangutan
rehabilitation centers might have been driven, in part, by a disdain for the hypocritical pretensions of some First-World environmental activists, Mohammed laughs brightly and
asks St. James if he&#8217;d like another piece of curry chicken. In any case, if
Al-Abdullah&#8217;s primary ambition was to close down any of the centers, he may
presently be a bit kerflummoxed by the net outcome of his actions. According
to Mohammed, a continuous influx of micro-donations from far-flung locations
like Tampere, Finland and Augusta, Maryland since the attacks has totaled in
the &#147;high seven figures&#148; at the O/URC alone, a greater than 50,000 percent
increase in the Center&#8217;s non-public revenue.</p>

</div>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">It had been fried chicken, not curry
chicken. Will knew because he remembered having curry chicken two days before,
when Marin had told them that she was leaving. Will knew because he had gone
with Walczek to canteen only once during her stay at the O/URC and had been
disturbed with her ability to dismantle and consume an entire fried chicken
thigh within six minutes. </p>

<p class="Story">Will had
compromised himself and witnessed the compromises of his colleagues many times
since the night of the Pure Homeland murders, but the line on all of those compromises had
been obscured and gray. The chicken, on the other hand, was a black-and-white
matter of truth and embellishment, of purposefully switching out an
incontrovertible fact in order to create a more convenient and persuasive
reality. This was not harmless. (Wan thought it was harmless.) This was not
funny. (Anwar thought it was funny.) This was certainly not Pulitzer-caliber
journalism. This was the slippery slope. This was beyond the slippery slope. This was abuse of discretion disguised as poetic license. This was:</p>

<p class="last">Chicken.</p>

<p class="first">Will was angry about chicken. Will was so
angry about chicken, in fact, that he was suffocating. He needed air. He
needed to breathe more and purer molecules of it. He needed to put at least
ten miles between himself and all other members of his own species. He broke
O/URC rules and went hiking in the open jungle alone.</p>

<p class="Story">Will&#8217;s frustration
wasn&#8217;t an innocent&#8217;s disappointment in human nature. Will&#8217;s seven years in
grad school had sufficiently lowered his expectations in his fellow man to
pragmatic levels. This was about a baseline standard of integrity and
transparency in communication. What was lost through what Walczek had done
with a single false word in her article was not justified by what was gained. Why could no one else see this?</p>

<p class="Story">Will moved quickly
through the canopy. His natural pace alone was faster even than his tandem
pace with his fastest hiking companion, Anwar. This was why orangutans
traveled alone. The answer to the core meta-question of all who studied the
species&#8217; behavior&#151;<i>Why do orangutans live and travel alone, unlike all of the
other great apes?</i>&#151;was, <i>duh</i>, speed. Question answered. Will could
move back to Canada now and write a game-changing book: <i>The Impatient Ape.</i></p>

<p class="Story">The hot thick air
seemed thin of oxygen. Birds cawed far away and then close. The sun slipped
through the trees in small patches of hot white nothing. Will was sweating
now, the skin of his arms, torso, and face wetting itself: its only trick. He
passed the familiar black stump that was the four-mile mark. The dirt felt dry
and cakey with days-old rain under his shoes. Will slowed down a little, a
breeze ran through the trees and cooled his wet skin, and he finally felt free.
</p>

<p class="Story">Will stopped and
stepped his right foot onto the root of a smooth, silver-barked tree. He crossed his arms over himself and grabbed his shoulders, stretching his back
muscles slightly. He got his water bottle out and drank a long draught of
sun-warmed water. Around him was so much authentic life magic that could not
sustain him. He felt like the lost hero of a fairy tale, alone in the
primary-growth woods. </p>

<p class="Story">Yes, anger,
pettiness, self-righteousness, self-pity: Will had been guilty of it all the
past few weeks. He was that guy who could not even be gracious about his lame
and unearned fifteen minutes of fame. Hell, he was that guy who screwed his
best friend and never called her again.</p>

<p class="Story">But Will didn&#8217;t
care. It was no use, to Marin or to himself, feeling remorseful about the
indefensible, or, even, trying to explain the most inexplicable moment to date
in a life filled with such riddles as a single gay man who chooses to live the
prime of his life in one of the most homophobic countries in the world, or a
science-lover who pursues one of the least science-driven fields of the
anthro-biological spectrum.</p>

<p class="Story">Will had witnessed
no less than four primatologist nervous breakdowns during his tenure at the
O/URC&#151;various foreign visiting researchers and doctoral students who suddenly
broke down in tears over a plate of rice in canteen or showed up in meet with
packed bags four months before their scheduled departure, demanding a ride to
Kuching. He&#8217;d despised all of these people for getting so far into their
careers without figuring out that they couldn&#8217;t handle real primatology
fieldwork. However, by this metric, Will was the worst of them all.</p>

<p class="Story">Will could
politicize his case, wrap a rainbow flag around it, but that would belie the
essential sameness of its fact-pattern: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0.25in"><i>i. Human Male C
felt lonely and adrift, missing the more enlightened culture of his home
country.</i></p>

<p style="margin:0;text-indent:0.25in"><i>ii. Human Male C repressed his feelings
(see i.) until they expressed themselves in a destructive, unprofessional
manner.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="first">There was a rustle of branches, and the
male orangutan Captain Kirk appeared on the opposite end of the clearing. In a
thrilling and unprecedented gesture, he bounded on all fours towards Will. </p>

<p class="Story">It was their
faces&#151;full of all manner of contradiction: largeness and smallness, ugliness
and beauty, brutality and peace. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to spend a lifetime, to
sacrifice one&#8217;s own material comforts, a degree of freedom in one&#8217;s private
life, for a chance at unlocking just one corner of the Pandora&#8217;s box that was
the heart of this strange, colossal beast? </p>

<p class="Story">Captain Kirk
brought his face to within a foot of Will&#8217;s and held it there for two slow
blinks. Will felt the animal&#8217;s heat on his own cheeks, smelled bitter tropical
fruit on his breath. </p>

<p class="Story">And then Kirk left,
became one with the canopy in a way that Will would never be one with anyone or
anything. </p>

<p class="Story">Will started
walking again. The other story of course, and the point of the curry chicken
paragraph in Walczek&#8217;s article, was that the O/URC was rich. Not ICT Industries
rich, not Prince of Brunei rich, but the O/URC was on track to break ten
million USD in online donations very soon. Even with the inevitable level-off
in giving, such a large lump sum, in combination with their apes&#8217;
internationally-televised martyrdom, meant that the O/URC could successfully
hold palm oil at bay for many years to come. </p>

<p class="Story">Will&#8217;s coworkers
wished that the windfall had come to them for any other reason, of course, but
they still seemed to appreciate the many positive things that it would make
possible. Wan, Anwar, Linda, Gandau, Dilip, Nolan, et al. had all
mourned the thirty Pure Homeland deaths and were moving on. Only Will persisted in feeling doomed. </p>

<p class="Story">The jungle path up
until now had been relatively clear, but past the five-mile mark, a white &#147;X&#148;
spray-painted onto a tree trunk, there was half-a-foot of botanical regrowth
over the O/URC&#8217;s cut path. Will had his machete with him, but its blade was
several weeks overdue for a sharpening. He didn&#8217;t care. If fried chicken
could become curry chicken, if thirty dead orangutans could be a fundraising
boon, Dr. Will St. James could use a dull axe to clear a hiking path. </p>

<p class="last">Will
held the machete by its wooden handle in both hands and swung to his right at
the green and brown crawlers on the ground, releasing the wet ripe stench of
freshly killed eden. He swung left at the same crawlers, the blade sticking in
the dried husk of a thick brown one. Will stepped on it and inched his blade
out. He struck it again in a narrower part of its neck further off the path. It went through. Will kicked the loosened stalks off to the sides with the toe
of his boot and then stepped forward into the new nine inches of cleared path
to start the process again.</p>

<p class="first">Two hours later, Will had cleared a grand
total of twelve yards of path, and his machete blade had only gotten duller. It stuck in every other weed with at least a two-inch diameter. Six yards
back, Will&#8217;s palms had begun blistering through the protective layer of
callous. Will hardly felt the pain of it. He had put canvas gloves on and
continued hacking away. He didn&#8217;t have to look to know that the increasing
moisture inside his gloves was only half sweat. </p>

<p class="Story">The choking noon
heat was a detoxifying sauna. Will&#8217;s sore shoulders and knees no more exerted
than by an ordinary weekday training session at the gym. </p>

<p class="Story">Trying to pry the
blade of his machete out of a black root-like vine, Will felt dizzy. He left
the axe in the plant, wiped sweat off his face with the uncovered part of his
forearm, and reached into his backpack for his water bottle. His gloved
fingers felt up the designed contours of his Swiss army knife, the foil wrapper
of a protein bar, the plastic column of his flashlight, and a small
spiral-bound notepad. Will sat on the ground and used both hands to keep the
bag&#8217;s mouth open as he positioned it in the light. It wasn&#8217;t possible, but it
had happened. The bottle wasn&#8217;t there. Will had left it when he&#8217;d stopped at
the four-mile mark: one-mile-plus back. </p>

<p class="Story">Will&#8217;s head felt
very heavy. He would rest and go back for the bottle. If he could only get
his machete. Will hardly could muster enough sustained stamina and focus to
locate it visually: see its square dirty blade stuck in that nasty black weed. He would have to leave it. It would only take him forty minutes to go back for
the bottle and come back. Will knew that he was badly dehydrated, but he could
walk&#151;the lightheadedness was just like being drunk, affecting the finer skills
of coordination but not the rote mechanics of stepping one foot in front of the
other. He&#8217;d once walked home thirty blocks in Montreal in the dead of winter
shitfaced drunk. He could walk one mile on a single, clear path. He pulled
off his gloves, revealing two blood- and pus-streaked palms, and headed out.</p>

<p class="Story">Two years living in
the jungle, hiking almost every day, and Will had never gotten heat
exhaustion. He didn&#8217;t know whether it made <i>sense</i> or was <i>ironic and
absurd</i> that it had happened the one time that he was alone. </p>

<p class="last">Will
hadn&#8217;t gotten far when he suddenly had to shit: the quick pain and downward
pressure of some foul something moving towards his ass. He had to act fast to
come out of this with his personhood intact. Will pulled out his notebook and
tore two blank pages from it. He pulled down his shorts and squatted off to
the side, relieving himself in the jungle. He wiped himself with the notebook
pages and threw the dirtied paper off into the trees. He pulled his shorts
back up and reached for the ground as he squatted and his head went ice cold
with sweat.</p>

<p class="first">Will came to to the spiraled plastic rim of
a water bottle being pushed to his lip. He smelled Wan&#8217;s warm tamarind smell
and felt Wan&#8217;s hand on the back of his head, holding it up. Will felt a vague
urge to make out with his boss. Instead, he sat up with a dizzy pinch and
drank. The visible world went in and out of black. There was a loud whack;
wood was breaking behind him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Drink it all,&#148; Wan
said. &#147;It will be a few more minutes still. Gandau&#8217;s making something to
carry you back in.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Wan stood up and
walked&#151;it seemed to Will a mile&#151;away.</p>

<p class="Story">Will could smell
his own shit roasting in the heat. He drank the water slowly and finished it. He could feel it in the bottom of his stomach. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sorry guys,&#148; Will
called out. &#147;I owe you one.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">He lay
down again and let the sound of Gandau&#8217;s chopping go quiet.</p>

<p class="first">Will was conscious for brief moments of the
journey home: lying down still on the makeshift bamboo stretcher as Wan and
Gandau tied him to it; feeling water slosh the sides of his belly as they
lifted him to their shoulders a few minutes later; hearing the rolled syllables
of Wan and Gandau speaking quietly in Bahasa as they hiked. For most of the trip,
however, Will&#8217;s more sophisticated powers of comprehension were obscured from
him behind some kind of neurological two-way mirror, and his beast-like brain
only understood that the body attached to it was overheated, strapped-down,
heavy, and craving darkness and cool.</p>

<p class="Story">Will heard shouting
and running. They were no longer on the jungle path. Will felt himself being
lowered to the ground. He looked up and saw the front facade of med. Wan and
Gandau untied the ropes strapping Will to the bamboo. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can you stand?&#148;
Wan asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Will nodded and
placed his feet off to the side of the stretcher on the ground. He stood
slowly, on jelloed muscles. His shorts were very loose, and he realized that
they were still unbuttoned and unzipped. He quickly remedied this as one of
the shouting and running people ran up to them and revealed himself to be
Anwar.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whoa,&#148; said
Anwar. &#147;What happen, lah?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You should go lie
down in the air-conditioning and drink more water,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Right,&#148; said
Will. &#147;I should wash my hands too.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will walked to med,
and for some reason&#151;a male understanding of a male&#8217;s need for privacy in such a
situation, he supposed&#151;nobody followed him. He opened the front door and went
inside the dark, dry, cool building, whose coolness and dryness felt even more
delicious than usual. He walked to the left to the small private bathroom. He
washed his hands and face at the sink with lots of the bitter antiseptic soap
from the dispenser on the wall. His blisters stung mildly, but he felt better
after. He found the one exam room with a mini-fridge, took a bottle of water
from the fridge, opened and drank half of it, and then hopped up on the empty
exam bed. </p>

<p class="Story">Will removed his
boots and put the water bottle on the small stainless steel equipment table
next to the bed. He laid down and closed his eyes.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>Money talks. </i>N.D., master
locksmith of the Pandora&#8217;s box of the human heart since 1976. </p>

<p class="Story">What had Will been
thinking? What a mess he had made of things. He supposed that he wasn&#8217;t the
first person in the world&#151;gay, straight, male, female&#151;to let a fear of
being/dying alone drive him to sleep with a friend that he wasn&#8217;t attracted to,
but still. </p>

<p class="Story">Will pressed his
blistered palms together, but the pain did not set him free. He heard the
front door of the building open and close, followed by boot-steps in the hall. He felt creepy listening in silence. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m in Exam Room
A!&#148; he called, sitting up and throwing his legs over the side of the table.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan came in a few
seconds later with a peeled and opened young coconut with a red straw sticking
out of its crown. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This is from May,&#148;
Wan said. He held the coconut out to Will.</p>

<p class="Story">Will took it and
took a weak sip of its buttery water, feeling undeserving.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How do you feel?&#148;
Wan asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Much better,&#148; said
Will. &#147;Embarrassed. Thank you for finding me&#133; carrying me five miles on a
handmade stretcher&#133; Best boss ever?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I try not to leave
my staff for dead,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will forced his
throat to produce a laugh-like sound and sipped at his coconut.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I feel embarrassed
even asking,&#148; Wan said. &#147;It is not my business, but if you&#8217;re going to be
hiking and clearing trails out in the jungle by yourself with no water and
almost dying&#133;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god, my
water bottle!&#148; Will said. &#147;I had it, I swear, but I accidentally left it at
the four-mile mark. Oh great, some macaque has brought it into the middle of
the jungle to never decompose.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, okay,&#148; said
Wan. &#147;So that&#8217;s why you didn&#8217;t have water. That&#8217;s a relief, I guess. You&#8217;re
slightly less crazy than we thought.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Slightly less
crazy? </i>Will
rolled his eyes: he didn&#8217;t know if he deserved <i>that</i>. &#147;What were you too
embarrassed to ask the crazy lone hiker?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What happened with
you and Marin?&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will frowned. &#147;What do you think?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Come on, Will,&#148;
Wan said. &#147;You stop hiking together. Marin leaves. You turn from the voice
of reason around here to this very angry person. You should at least talk
about it. I&#8217;m an animal doctor, not a psychiatrist. I won&#8217;t psycho-analyze
you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I never hear you
talk about your personal life,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s not an
answer,&#148; Wan said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will sipped his
coconut dry.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; Wan said. &#147;On Steph&#8217;s last night here, she came to my bungalow in the middle of the
night.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You and Walczek?&#148;
Will said. &#147;Isn&#8217;t she married?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Wan. &#147;Nothing
happened <i>lah</i>. We just talked. I am sure she loves her husband and
would not cheat him. I think she just wanted to know if I have any feeling for
her, you know? That she&#8217;s still a woman men want. After she left, I felt quite used
actually.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whoa,&#148; Will said,
purposefully but not mockingly invoking Anwar. &#147;Geez.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And that is my
personal life,&#148; Wan said. &#147;A talk with a married woman in the middle of the
night. Quite sad, isn&#8217;t it?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you feel better
talking about it?&#148; asked Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, actually, I do,&#148;
he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Me and Marin,&#148;
Will said. He wanted to tell Wan the truth, the whole truth, but now wasn&#8217;t
the right time. Will was beginning to realize that his orientation had had
little to do with what had happened with him and Marin. That it also had had
little to do with his attitude problems and poor decision-making as of late. &#147;I messed up big-time, basically,&#148; Will said. &#147;She&#8217;s smart, pretty, cool, and
fun, but I just have never been attracted to her in that way. We slept
together that night after we all got drunk in canteen&#151;after <i>I</i> got us all
drunk in canteen. But it soon became clear that I wasn&#8217;t interested in
anything more. I&#8217;m a pretty awesome guy like that.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Poor Marin,&#148; Wan
said. &#147;You two were so close&#133; right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It is what it is,&#148;
Will said. &#147;Hopefully one day she can find it in her heart to forgive me.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We all make
mistakes,&#148; Wan said. &#147;Even orangutans.&#148;</p>

<div class="ouro"><%= image_tag "books/o/ouroboros.png", alt: "***" %></div>

<p class="first">The wild orangutan Daisy&#151;several months
pregnant&#151;had injured herself in early November while being tracked by Linda and
Gandau. She&#8217;d grabbed a rotten branch that had broken under her weight. She&#8217;d
broken her right arm in the fall. </p>

<p class="Story">The O/URC had taken
Daisy in, Linda had set her broken arm, and now she was in O.Q. waiting to give
birth. </p>

<p class="Story">One week after
Will&#8217;s heat exhaustion episode, Daisy went into labor. Unfortunately her water
broke smack dab in the middle of one of Linda&#8217;s bi-monthly weekends in
Kuching. Dilip was able to get a hold of Linda on her cellphone, but if the
traffic was bad enough it was possible that she wouldn&#8217;t make it back in time. In which case, Will would have to deliver the first orangutan baby of his
career.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan gave Daisy a
small dose of sedation&#151;only enough to keep her from running off in a panic&#151;and
he and Anwar brought her into med. </p>

<p class="Story">Will changed into
scrubs and took his time washing his hands in the scrub room. Then he went
into the operating room where Wan and Anwar were laying a fitful Daisy down on
the operating table. </p>

<p class="Story">She screamed a
bird-like screech and grabbed her distended belly with both hands. She kicked
the table hard with her right heel, and the metal rang out like a gong.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Shhhh&#133;</i>&#148;
said Anwar. He placed the palm of his hand on her head. Even injured and
pregnant, she was a powerful animal. It wouldn&#8217;t be a pretty delivery if she
wasn&#8217;t calm.</p>

<p class="Story">Will called Linda&#8217;s
cellphone, and when she picked up he put her on speaker. She started going
over the steps of the &#147;operation,&#148; possible complications, and what to do in
the event of each of the most probable complications. Then she asked Dilip for
Daisy&#8217;s blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, cervical dilation, and heart
rate. After Dilip updated Linda on Daisy, Linda asked Will to repeat as much
of what she&#8217;d just told him about the delivery as he could remember. He did
so, and she corrected him where he was wrong. Linda then said that she and her
husband were still approximately an hour and a half away.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda,&#148; Will
said. &#147;I feel like in your instructions, there is this implied assumption that
I can communicate with Daisy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can&#8217;t you?&#148; Linda
said. She hung up.</p>

<p class="Story">Will put on a pair
of fresh latex gloves and walked over to the operating table. The
double-arch-shaped bump of Daisy&#8217;s brow framed small cola-brown eyes whose
large white lids&#151;four of them, two tops and two bottoms&#151;moved open and closed
slightly. Daisy&#8217;s arm cast had been removed, and the fur that had been under
it was still matted back around her arm, instead of brushed and loose. Her
arms were twice as long as her legs and her shoulders broad: the inheritance of
many millennia spent in the trees. Her breasts and abdomen were swollen to
capacity: the hope of this inheritance&#8217;s perpetuation incarnate. Will reached
over and gently felt the orangutan&#8217;s injured arm. It felt nearly healed. She
and the baby could probably be taken back to the spot in Section A where she&#8217;d
injured herself as early as tomorrow.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re a fast
healer like me, Daisy,&#148; Will said. </p>

<p class="Story">Dilip, coming over
with a razor to re-shave the small area on Daisy&#8217;s belly that had been cleared
for ultrasounds, smiled. He looked down at the table, and his focus
recalibrated on something. His smile disappeared.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is this blood?&#148; he
said. He hurried to the end of the table and moved Daisy&#8217;s right leg to the
side. &#147;She&#8217;s bleeding out her vagina,&#148; he said. &#147;This isn&#8217;t right.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They called Linda
again. Linda told them a few things to check, but she said she didn&#8217;t know
what was wrong. She would have to see Daisy in person to be of more help. She
was still an hour or more away.</p>

<p class="Story">They were on their
own. </p>

<p class="Story">Will checked everything
again. Everything was normal. The bleeding could mean something very bad or
nothing at all. <i>You don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know</i>, as he used to say. </p>

<p class="Story">He would have to
take a leap of faith: in the universe, in himself. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Make sure she has
enough water,&#148; Will said to Dilip. &#147;She&#8217;s going to be okay.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And the baby?&#148;
said Dilip.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The baby too,&#148;
Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Dilip left to get a
clean sippy cup from the med storage closet. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re doing good,
Will,&#148; Wan said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If you want to
jump in here at any point, be my guest,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No need,&#148; Wan
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Dilip came back
with the water and gave the cup to Daisy. She&#8217;d never used a sippy cup before
(they gave the apes in O.Q. water in bowls) but figured it out right away and
drank it all. </p>

<p class="Story">Will mopped up the
blood with some towels, and no new blood appeared.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have O.Q. duty,&#148;
Anwar said. &#147;Take picture.&#148; He left.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I saw the camera
bag in the closet,&#148; Dilip said. &#147;Why you keeping it here? Any reasons? Wan?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Since we&#8217;ve been
having so many other cameras around&#133;&#148; Wan said. &#147;I thought it best to keep
ours in the air-conditioning until we need it. I&#8217;ll go get it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Was it possible
that they hadn&#8217;t taken any photos since the durian-eating fiesta in the
clearing outside O.Q., the day before the murders? And how had Wan had the
forethought to move the nice, expensive camera to med in the meantime? Will
was spooked, but not surprised. <i>Some creatures just operate on a different
level than the rest of us</i>, he reminded himself.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan came back with
the camera and took a few shots of Daisy, Will, and Dilip pre-delivery.</p>

<p class="Story">A half-an-hour
later they started the pushing. Daisy screamed. Like a time-lapse
video of a flower from hell, her lower body had opened and revealed its inside
parts, but the precious fruit of the bud was stuck deep inside. Will found
himself communicating&#151;somehow&#151;with the wild orangutan, telling her to ignore
the pain and push her cargo into the world, and he felt her understand him,
felt her let go of the knots of fear in her heart and trust him. Blood,
cervical fluid and tissue, sweat, and fur Pollocked up his scrubs. There was
the sour smell of all true things. If Linda and Wan had wanted this delivery
to be Will&#8217;s trial by fire, it was downright Pentecostal to be in that room, to
look at the violence between this animal&#8217;s legs, and hope for life, for a
future of trees and fruit and climbing, sex and joy and learning and progress. </p>

<p class="Story">Linda swung the
operating room door open and ran in in scrubs, snapping on a pair of gloves as
the baby crowned: a swamp- and moss-covered stone stretching the jaws of
Daisy&#8217;s hips. Its thin, sharp cry pierced the silence. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Its lungs are
working, at least,&#148; Will said, standing up from his crouch with the sticky,
weightless newborn in his hands. It was a boy.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda squeezed some
ultrasound gel on Daisy&#8217;s stomach and ran the transducer over her
flattened uterus. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Looks okay,&#148; she
said. </p>

<p class="Story">Will gave Linda the
baby.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What are we going
to name him?&#148; she asked, with a loopy, unfamiliar smile.</p>

<p class="Story">Dilip brought over
a metal pan filled with soapy water. Linda set the orangutan in it and washed
its pygmy body gently. Wan took pictures. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s Daisy&#8217;s son,&#148;
Will said. &#147;Duke? Too clever?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Works for me,&#148;
said Wan. </p>

<p class="Story">Daisy was sitting
up on the table now, and Linda handed Duke to her. Daisy cradled her son,
rested her cheek on Duke&#8217;s chest, and closed her eyes, serene as the deepest
ocean floor.</p>

<p class="Story">For the second time
in the past several hours, Will was aware of others operating on a different
level than himself. </p>

<p class="last">The
tears whose salt that he tasted moments later, alone in the locker room, may
have sprung from the quite rational fear that he had no more leaps of faith
left in him, none for himself anyway. Looking back at this moment later,
however, Will was partial to a baptismal interpretation: holy waters cleansing
him of the past and opening his heart to everything that would follow.</p>

<p class="first">A crowd of O/URC staff had gathered on the
front lawn of med, waiting for news of the delivery, the O/URC&#8217;s first wild
orangutan birth in a very long time and the O/URC&#8217;s first opportunity to make
up for the ground lost by the Pure Homeland attacks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s a boy!&#148; Will
said. &#147;Healthy, three pounds, ten ounces. We named him Duke.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Someone started
applauding, and everyone else joined in. May started to cry. Most of the
crowd then dispersed: back to work.</p>

<p class="Story">Linda&#8217;s husband,
Cheh, had been among those waiting. He was dressed in a white dress shirt,
blue tie, and khakis. When Linda came out a few minutes later wearing a blue
dress and heels, Will realized that it was Sunday and that the Tsais must have
driven straight from church. Cheh took Linda&#8217;s hand and kissed it, and asked
Linda something in Chinese. Linda laughed and gave him a pithy reply in her
most deadpan deadpan.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey everybahhdy,&#148;
Cheh called. He waved at Will and the other four people still on the lawn. &#147;Linda and I want everyone here to be some of the first to knowing: get ready
to go through these excitement again in six months, because we are having a
baby!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; said
Gandau. &#147;You are pregnant? Three months pregnant?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, and it&#8217;s 100%
human, just to be clear,&#148; Linda said. &#147;So, God be my witness, I will not be
giving birth in med.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone laughed,
and there were hugs and follow-up questions and long calls to people on the
porch of canteen (the nearest building) and passing by on the lattice path.</p>

<p class="last">After
a bit of awkward socializing, Will went back into the med locker room to get
his phone. There was a text message from Anwar:</p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>Waaaaahhht??? Linda</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>preggggg??? OMG</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>scarry baby coming lah</i></p>

<p class="txtmsg"><i>loL</i></p>

<p class="posttxt" style="margin-bottom:0">Will chuckled and
deleted the message, and Linda came in, alone. She zipped up the large handbag
on the bench by her locker and swung it up onto her shoulder.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Way to steal
Daisy&#8217;s thunder Linda,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What?&#148; Linda said.
</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just kidding,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, yeah, me
also,&#148; she said. She took a step towards the door. &#147;It&#8217;s a good thing, Will,&#148;
she said. &#147;That we&#8217;re moving on.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I know,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you think if
you could choose,&#148; Linda said, &#147;you would choose to have kept things the way
they were before: no murders, no TV reporters, no money?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But Linda,&#148; he
said, &#147;you never get a choice like that. And isn&#8217;t that &#8216;God&#8217;s&#8217; judgment
anyway?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Reverend Chua says
that since the orangutans&#8217; souls were pure, the sin and the tragedy of their
deaths lies only in the killers&#8217; refusal to know God. Reverend Chua says that
the Sixth Commandment is not about the inherent sinfulness of killing as much
as it is about taking away another human soul&#8217;s time on earth before that
person has earned their rightful place in heaven.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So Reverend Chua
would choose money and murders,&#148; said Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Reverend Chua is a
practical man,&#148; said Linda. She let that sit for a moment. &#147;There are so many
truly terrible things and so many truly terrible people in this world,&#148; she
said. &#147;One three-letter word is not enough for every thing that every person
does that is not 100% perfect.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda, there&#8217;s
something you should know about me if we&#8217;re going to continue to work together
as peers,&#148; Will said. &#147;I&#8217;m gay. Another one of those inadequate three-letter
words&#133; If that&#8217;s going to be a problem for you, I won&#8217;t take it personally,
but&#151;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will would never
truly know what Linda had thought at this moment, any more than he could know
for certain what Captain Kirk had thought that day, one week ago, staring Will
down in the clearing in the jungle. All that he had were her words.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Will, you&#8217;re a
good man and a good scientist,&#148; Linda said. &#147;That&#8217;s all I need to know to work
with you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well&#133;&#148; Will said. &#147;I&#8217;m not that good.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The pregnant lady
is always right,&#148; said Linda.</p>

<p class="last">Will
laughed and tried not to get too blubbery.</p>

<p class="first">After a festive dinner in canteen that
night, Will went to office to check his email. He felt inspired to write to
his father about Daisy&#8217;s delivery, and if he didn&#8217;t do it now while he was
inspired, he never would.</p>

<p class="Story">Will let himself in
through the front door and turned on the hallway light: he was alone. He
walked to his office, unlocked and opened the door, and turned on the light. He sat down at his desk and turned on his computer. </p>

<p class="Story">He had
approximately twenty unread messages. The top two had the same subject header&#151;
&#147;It&#8217;s a boy-utan!&#148;&#151;and were from Marin and Wan, respectively.</p>

<p class="Story">Wan had emailed a
few photos from the birth already: mostly of Daisy and Duke, but there was a
funny one of Dilip and Will leaned over Will&#8217;s cellphone flipped open on a
table, talking to Linda.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had been on
Wan&#8217;s cc: list and had replied-all back. </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="email" style="margin:0">From:

</div>

<p class="Story">Will wanted to be a
good man. Strange how the faith of another person in his inherent goodness
felt just as unbearable as doubt. </p>

<p class="Story">He read Marin&#8217;s
email again, thought that he could read guarded pain in between the lines. His
kneejerk reaction to such pain&#151;a mix of impatience, disgust, and pity&#151;was not
that of a good man. On the long, hard road to becoming the kind of man that
truly deserved Linda Tsai&#8217;s god-defying faith, the first step would be the most
difficult, but it could not be skipped.</p>

<h2>San Francisco : 2005</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he officiator of Ben and Judith&#8217;s wedding
looked over Marin&#8217;s resume, uncapped blue ink pen in hand.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You speak <i>five </i>languages?&#148;
Deepna Rasjani said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Two and a half
dialects of Chinese, Tagalog, and English,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Still,&#148; Deepna
said, circling all four Asian languages at the bottom of the resume. &#147;Very
impressive. And we do see a lot of clientele for all of those dialects and
Tagalog as well.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So why did you
leave Pac?&#148; Deepna said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The first time or
the second time?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Deepna smiled. &#147;The first and the second times,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The first time
because I was given a unique opportunity to work at a constituent organization
overseas, and I knew that I would always regret it if I didn&#8217;t take it,&#148; Marin
said. She was not too proud for feeble doublespeak&#151;if that was what was truly
required to earn a woman like Deepna&#8217;s trust in this context. &#147;Also, I had
other misgivings with the organization at that point: the bureaucracy and
internal politics come with the territory, but I also had started to doubt the
real world efficacy of some of our&#151;Pac&#8217;s&#151;loan projects.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Deepna scribbled
something in a narrow shorthand next to the first Pac Development Bank block on
Marin&#8217;s resume.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A week and a half
after I moved back to San Francisco last year, by chance I ran into my former
boss at Pac, Ray Marcos, at a restaurant one night,&#148; Marin said. &#147;He told me
to email him about jobs, and, since I didn&#8217;t have anything lined up yet, this
seemed like kismet. Pac, for all its imperfections, is a great organization,
and its data/information department is the second-largest source of validated
statistics on the Asia-Pacific region in the world. I learned a lot at
Pac&#151;both with Ray and in DatInf, but I know that I can do more.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, so after
out-growing Pac, you left again in January. Right now it&#8217;s August. The past
seven, eight months have been, what?&#148; Deepna asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin&#8217;s role in the
Mel White/Gil Garcia hoax had been recounted (in excruciating detail) in most
of the in-depth media coverage of the hoax, but Marin wasn&#8217;t surprised that
Deepna did not appear familiar with it. Marin would not have been surprised if
Deepna had never heard of Gil Garcia at all. Deepna lived in the real world. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Right around the
time that I had been thinking of looking for a new job, Berkeley&#8217;s extension
program announced that it was hosting a political philosophy seminar with a
Princeton professor who&#8217;s kind of a rock star in his field,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Deepna named the
professor.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, so you know,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;It filled up in the first hour that sign-ups for spring classes
went online. Well, I got in, and I&#8217;m glad I wasn&#8217;t coming to it after eight
hours at Pac DatInf because the class was fabulous. I also taught myself MySQL
and took an intermediate Mandarin class at that time and have been tutoring the
SAT twenty hours a week since May.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Deepna nodded and
made a note next to the second Pac block on Marin&#8217;s resume.</p>

<p class="Story">When Marin had come
to the Mandala Women&#8217;s Refugee Center for Ben&#8217;s wedding last September, its
sunny, colorful, and open interiors had made an impression on her. The large
communal work tables that anchored the public space of each of its four floors
had been littered with, respectively: the laminated multilingual signs,
taped-off divisions, and plastic hanging file boxes of an evening immigration
clinic; donated film and computer equipment systematically deconstructed and
tagged for reassembly and hack; the raw materials of an ambitious
silk-screening project; and boxes of brochures and handouts, in at least ten
different languages, on rape and abuse victim counseling and services offered
by Mandala and its partners. </p>

<p class="Story">Deepna&#8217;s office was
on the fourth floor. A half-hour ago, as Marin had followed Deepna&#8217;s assistant
up the hardwood plank stairs that circled the skylight-roofed atrium, Marin had
found, happily, that her earlier impression had not been off the mark. A mix
of playful and serious endeavor, a 90% female workforce, and a rich aroma of
steeping chamomile and bergamot animated each floor and suggested that office
work could in fact be very different from what she had previously known.</p>

<p class="Story">Unfortunately, the
only listing on the jobs page of Mandala&#8217;s website was for a part-time law
clerk, but Marin had carefully studied the 2004, 2003, and 2002 Forms 990 that
Mandala had posted to the Guidestar database and had noted that contractor fees of
$89,404 had been paid to Accenture IT Services in 2002, followed by $72,200 to
Prime Analytics in 2003 and $79,882 to Prime Analytics in 2004. From due
diligence of the websites of Accenture, Prime Analytics, and Mandala, Marin had
deduced that, over the past three years, the non-profit had contracted out both
the design and maintenance of a data bank for its many programs and clientele.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin explained to
Deepna how she&#8217;d arrived at this deduction. </p>

<p class="Story">Deepna stared at
her intently, gave her nothing.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have both policy
programming and data analysis experience,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I think that whatever
you&#8217;re having Prime Analytics do, I can do at 60% of the price. Additionally,
due to my range of practical experience I can bundle that with a level of
qualitative analysis a contracted engineering team simply cannot. There is
tremendous opportunity here to capture and use data in novel ways to make a
self-improving, fleet-footed, and extraordinarily responsive organization.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It takes a lot of
nerve to make up and then apply for a non-existent job,&#148; Deepna said. &#147;Some
would say arrogance.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I like to think of
it as &#8216;entrepreneurial spirit,&#8217;&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">Deepna smiled
warmly. &#147;When I started Mandala, in the early nineties, every other man my age
in this town was an entrepreneur. It was almost considered a riskier move <i>not</i>
to quit your job and start your own business: if you were a man. However, for
some reason, I and my little four-person 501(c)(3) operation were considered
the edge of reason by most of my former Hewlett Foundation coworkers!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not interested
in short cuts,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I&#8217;m willing to work hard for relatively cheap to
learn and earn a place at an organization with a real vision, platform, and
agenda.&#148; </p>

<p class="last">&#147;Well,
hiring is a very important part of Mandala&#8217;s vision, as you probably know, and
I take each hiring decision very seriously,&#148; Deepna said. &#147;You&#8217;ve certainly
given me a lot to think about, Marin. I&#8217;ll give you a call next week.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">When Marin got to the address in Ben&#8217;s
email, she saw the rented moving truck parked on the street in front of the
building&#8217;s garage driveways. Jorge appeared at its open back cradling a
computer monitor.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin!&#148; he said. &#147;Welcome to the show. Benjamin just took some things inside. He&#8217;ll be back.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The building&#8217;s
front gate and door had been propped open, and Ben appeared at the front door
as Jorge slowly stepped down out of the van with the monitor. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh great, you
found us,&#148; Ben said. &#147;Thanks again for helping. How was your interview?&#148; He
left the building and walked up to her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really good,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;She&#8217;s suspicious about all of the job-hopping, obviously, but she
said she&#8217;d call me next week. If she offers me anything short of cleaning
toilets at Mandala, I&#8217;ll probably take it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s awesome,&#148;
Ben said. &#147;Deepna is a really solid human being all-around.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, thanks again
for pushing me to email her, by the way,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Also, Judith emailed me
back on Tuesday. She was totally fine with it and actually really
encouraging.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, great,&#148; Ben
said. &#147;I&#8217;m glad.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nazneen, on the
other hand&#133;&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re dead to
her, man,&#148; Jorge said, walking by with the monitor. &#147;And we are too, by
association.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think we&#8217;re even
more dead to Nazneen than Ben,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think it&#8217;s
actually you that&#8217;s the deadest, then Ben, then me,&#148; Jorge said. &#147;Sorry. It&#8217;s
some kind of feminist or post-feminist betrayal-anger.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re
fine being public enemy number one for me?&#148; Ben asked Marin. &#147;I can make new
divorc&#233; adulterer friends. Or get a cat.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wasn&#8217;t there,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;All I know is what you and she have told me, and she refuses to
talk about it with me! Nazneen is great when I&#8217;m the one who needs help and
advice and a sympathetic ear, but a real friendship goes both ways.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Maybe she doesn&#8217;t
want to burden you with her drama,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If she&#8217;s making
all of us choose between you and her, then she&#8217;s burdened us already,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;Anyways, friendship&#8217;s not about keeping conversations pleasant and
drama-free. It&#8217;s about letting yourself be vulnerable, sharing, and trusting
other people with your deepest, darkest, yuckiest stuff.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s hard though,&#148;
Ben said. &#147;When the well goes pretty deep, and you dug it yourself.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had never
been more proud to be Ben&#8217;s friend than in the past few months. She had been
his close confidant as he: hit bottom, told Nazneen that their night together
had been wonderful but not the beginning of anything between them, came clean to Judith about his
infidelity and the irrational yet undeniable dissipation of his affections starting the
previous November, found a divorce lawyer and a new apartment, and slowly
pieced his career back together. Ben had admitted complicity in his failures,
and had begun making peace with his lack of control over those of his
misfortunes that had been bad luck. </p>

<p class="Story">The choices hadn&#8217;t
gotten easier. Marin wished that she hadn&#8217;t had to choose between mercurial,
loyal, well-connected Nazneen and thoughtful, charming, grounded Ben. However, Marin felt more confident about her ability to judge and make
life&#8217;s impossible decisions&#151;to choose and commit to the tradeoffs inherent to
adult life&#151;than she had, say, a year and a half ago. </p>

<p class="Story">Hopefully Nazneen
could forgive her one day.</p>

<p class="Story">On the topic of unsettled
tabs, Marin&#8217;s sometime friend Will St. James was in town for two days on his
three-continent, five-country honeymoon, and Marin was meeting him and his
husband William for a drink at Demographie, a beer garden in the Mission, at
four-thirty. Marin hadn&#8217;t been in touch with Will, hadn&#8217;t known that he and
William were still together&#151;let alone that they had gotten married&#151;until Will
had emailed her a week ago to see if she wanted to meet up when he and William
were in the city.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin was happy for
them: she had liked William. She just wished that she had known a year and a
half ago what she knew now. She would have probably made the same choice on
Full Moon, but it would have meant something different to her.</p>

<p class="last">Ben
had mounted the moving truck&#8217;s box. He picked up and handed Marin a cardboard
box and told her to carry it to the living room of Apartment 4 on the second
floor. </p>

<p class="first">It took two hours to finish unpacking the
truck. Jorge drove it back to the lot alone. Marin was helping Ben move a
loveseat to the open space under the living room window when her cellphone
rang.</p>

<p class="Story">They put the
loveseat down, and Marin fished her phone out of her purse. It was her father.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hello?&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hi, it&#8217;s Dad,&#148;
Walter said. &#147;I just talked to Jim. He talked to his friend at the Horizon
Group last week about Mel White. She said she&#8217;d be seeing Mel White&#8217;s
psychiatrist on Monday and would mention something to him about the money.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, thanks Dad,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I&#8217;m not expecting much, but it certainly can&#8217;t hurt.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it&#8217;s the
psychiatrist&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss that Jim knows, so it definitely can&#8217;t hurt,&#148; Walter
said. &#147;I&#8217;ve got to go into a meeting now, but see you Sunday for dim sum,
okay?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, see you
soon,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Thanks, Dad.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye, Marin,&#148;
Walter said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Bye.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Walter had moved to
San Jose two months ago and was loving his new town and job. He had a bunch of
new friends from work, and Jim and Veronica Valiant organized and invited
Walter to frequent dinners, potlucks, sports viewing parties, movies, and hikes
all over the Peninsula. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin saw her
father almost every other Sunday for dim sum in Daly City. Approximately once
a month, they did something fun in the city together. She was a little
surprised to realize it, but she very much enjoyed having her father around. Occasionally when she was with Walter, she had to ignore some awful piece of
Ailes-styled rhetoric that came out of his mouth. During these moments, Marin
reminded herself that Walter was the one person who had seen through Mel White.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Dad?&#148; Ben asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Marin. &#147;His coworker&#8217;s daughter works at a non-profit in Oakland, and his
coworker heard that they&#8217;re having trouble filling a position there. My dad&#8217;s
going to get more info.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ah,&#148; Ben said. &#147;So where do you guys want to eat tonight? My treat.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, I don&#8217;t care,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Jorge was the one helping you all morning; he should decide.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s that new
place by Vaudeville,&#148; Ben said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh yeah, the
Cambodian place,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Angkor Select?&#148; he
said. &#147;It got a good review in <i>SF Weekly</i>. Jorge and I were talking
about it last week, and he said he wanted to try it sometime.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sure, sounds
great,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, I&#8217;ll make a
reservation for dinner,&#148; Ben said. &#147;You&#8217;re meeting your Borneo friends at
four?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Four-thirty,&#148;
she said. &#147;I should be done by six-thirty or seven. And I&#8217;ll only be a few
blocks away at Demographie.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">It was one of San Francisco&#8217;s handful of
hot summer days, and Demographie, with its outdoor gravel pit of
communal picnic tables, busy grill, and respectable selection of draft beer,
would be crowded and a little gross.</p>

<p class="Story">Will and William
were sitting side-by-side at one end of a table in the outdoor area, talking to
the rowdy group of attractive tattooed locals at their table that had, if the
pile of ketchup-streaked plates and emptied glasses in the center of the table
were any indication, spent the entire afternoon there.</p>

<p class="Story">The intra-table
interaction seemed to come to its natural conclusion just at that moment. </p>

<p class="Story">William saw Marin
first, and waved. Will looked up at her and smiled.</p>

<p class="Story">After all this
time, after Charlie and William, Marin still felt echoes of thwarted affection
looking into Will&#8217;s smiling face. <i>Even the most human-acting ex-captive
orangutan was never so confused</i>, she thought. <i>But I&#8217;m over it.</i></p>

<p class="Story">Still, she needed a
drink, and said as much once she&#8217;d hugged Will and William and sat down across
from them.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ll get it,&#148;
William said, standing. &#147;You guys probably want to catch up.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Any draft beer is
fine,&#148; Marin said, taking out her wallet and pulling a ten-dollar bill from it.</p>

<p class="Story">William waved away
her money. He grinned at Will. &#147;I know what <i>you </i>want,&#148; William said,
giving Will&#8217;s shoulder a squeeze.</p>

<p class="Story">Will looked up at
him and laughed. The newlyweds couldn&#8217;t stop smiling at each other. </p>

<p class="Story">William left for
the bar.</p>

<p class="Story">Will slid over a
few inches so that he was directly in front of Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I can&#8217;t believe
you&#8217;re married,&#148; she said. &#147;And yet you are so totally Married Guy now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Crazy what can
happen in a year,&#148; Will said. He turned his wedding band one half-inch
clockwise with the fingers on his other hand, as if it were a nut that he was
screwing tighter onto the bolt of his finger.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So is William
living in Malaysia?&#148; Marin asked. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;His firm has an
office in Hong Kong, and he got transferred there a few months after he got
home from Thailand,&#148; Will said. &#147;So we split our time between Hong Kong and
Borneo. We bought the most ridiculously beautiful house in Kuching in
January. All the traveling is hard sometimes, but it also keeps us on our
toes. What about you, are you seeing anyone?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin told him
about Charlie and, glossing over the more confusing parts of the GXG story,
Charlie&#8217;s betrayal. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sorry, Marin,
that&#8217;s terrible,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had run into
Charlie three weeks ago at the worker-owned coop grocery on Folsom Street. It
had pissed her off that he was there. It had pissed her off that he had a
bottle of soy sauce and a bag of frozen dumplings in his basket. It had pissed
her off that he had made friendly small talk with her as if she were some random
acquaintance, not the ex-girlfriend whose phone calls he stopped returning one
day in order to make it less awkward when&#151;to further his career&#151;he published an
article in <i>Harper&#8217;s</i> about her extremely costly failure to see the true
nature of things.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We were never
right for each other,&#148; Marin said now to Will. &#147;It&#8217;s for the best. It was
really nice having someone, though. To go to parties with, if anything.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will laughed. &#147;I
know what you mean. When I remember all of the angst that I used to have&#133;
having William, even when he&#8217;s in Hong Kong and I&#8217;m at the O/URC, it makes all
the difference in the world. I just hope that I&#151;what I did&#151;didn&#8217;t make it
difficult for you to trust and open up to men.&#148; He spoke clearly, but waited
until he&#8217;d finished to look at her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Will, no,&#148; Marin
said, shaking her head, &#147;that was different. We both obviously weren&#8217;t
thinking straight. I mean, I&#151;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You deserve what I
have with William,&#148; Will said, &#147;You&#8217;re a wonderful person, Marin. You were a
really good friend to me when I was going through a difficult time in my life,
and I&#8217;m sorry that I abused your trust.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin felt
uncomfortable and a little bit angry. Will&#8217;s mini-benediction was clearly
heartfelt and would soothe her ego in some future moment when she was removed
from the reality-distortion field of True Love. However, at this moment, all
she could see in Will&#8217;s words was more manifest proof that the person sitting
across the table from her had a handsome, loving husband and well-rounded,
emotionally-fulfilling life and that she did not. </p>

<p class="Story">Moreover, Will had not
yet touched on what to Marin was clearly the more disturbing event of their
acquaintance. Marin had forgiven Will a long time ago for breaking her heart. It was Will&#8217;s perfect impression of Switzerland on Full Moon night at Koh Phangan
that had more than intermittently fed her demons of cynicism and resentment
over the intervening year and a half.</p>

<p class="Story">No amount of power
or money ever changes hands without expectations and resentment. Marin
knew this now and was probably better for it. An apology from Will for Koh
Phangan, at this point, would probably just confuse her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I accept your
apology,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="last">William
came back with their beers, and Will launched into gossip mode, updating Marin
on the O/URC&#8217;s most interesting goings-on. Linda had had her baby, a girl
named Gia, and Will and William had thrown Gia a humans-only first birthday
party at their Kuching house in June. Will was out to Wan, Anwar, and Nolan
now, in addition to Linda, but they told everyone else that William was Will&#8217;s
very close cousin. And, small world, Wayan Wijaya had recently reached out to Wan to sit on the board of Pac-Malaysia and Pac-Indonesia&#8217;s new bi-country sustainable development committee. He had accepted.</p>

<p class="first">Marin hurried home at six-fifty. The
nursery tint and tone of the late twilight sky made the studded skulls and
jagged crystals on display in the windows of Coven Press look like little
girls&#8217; playthings. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin wanted to
change from cropped to long pants before meeting Ben and Jorge at Angkor
Select. Although it was still warm at the moment, knowing San Francisco nights
as she did, she felt comfortable predicting that the walk home after dinner
would likely be much more comfortable with fully-covered legs. And Marin had
just enough time.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin opened her
building&#8217;s gate and stepped into the vestibule. With her littlest key, she
opened her mailbox. Inside was a sealed number 10 envelope addressed in a
familiar handwriting. She took it to her apartment to open.</p>

<p class="Story">Inside the envelope
was a check for $68,000 and a San Francisco postcard with a stock photo of the
Golden Gate Bridge on the front. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin couldn&#8217;t
believe it: Walter had come through. </p>

<p class="Story">On the back of the
postcard, Mel White had written: </p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p class="first"><i>The man with two faces frowns penitent in
both. Agnes M. of shiny shiny fame land wants to put the story of the
two-faced man on the magic mirror for the world to see. Miss Aggie needs
trolls for her bridge of money. Whaddya talk whaddya talk. For
bridge-building, Ms. Spring Colors herself requested you contact her at: ALPHA
MAY PRODUCTIONS, 48501 VENTURA BLVD., SHERMAN OAKS, CA 91403, 818-644-4444,
ag@alphamay.com.</i></p>

<p class="Epigraph2"><i>&#151;Mel W., 2005.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="Story">Marin left the
postcard, check, and envelope on her desk and changed into jeans. She was
relieved to have finally completed the trickier items on her day&#8217;s agenda. The
remaining item would be nothing but fun. She washed her face and redid her
hair. </p>

<p class="Story">She went back into
the living room, clipped the check to the envelope with a one-inch binder clip,
picked up Mel White&#8217;s postcard, turned on her electronic shredder, and fed it
the postcard. </p>

<p class="Story">The possibilities
of life were not limitless, but a world that had invented electronic shredder
machines couldn&#8217;t be all bad. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin shut off the
shredder, grabbed her purse, slipped her sandals back on, left and locked up
her apartment, and ran down the stairs to dinner. </p>

<h2>Koh Phangan : 2004</h2>
<h3>Marin</h3>

<p class="first"><span style="font-size:200%">T</span>he boat reached
Thong Sala well before sunrise, but there were plenty of jeepney drivers
waiting for them at the pier, in the dark. It was Full Moon season again
already, a little bit earlier every month. </p>

<p class="Story">The price offered
by the first driver who approached Marin was fair so she followed him to his
jeepney and boarded its back. There was only one other passenger, a pretty
blond backpacker, and his aloof stare precluded conversation. Marin settled
into the unexpected luxury of having half a truck bed to herself as the driver
gassed up and they drove up the small dirt hill to the road. </p>

<p class="Story">The island was
greener than Marin had imagined it would be. She smelled the pickling joints
of trees and the salt of the breeze and heard no one, but the island didn&#8217;t
feel empty or friendless. She sensed the curved outlines of an excitement
forming, a bottled-up tension approaching release. It helped that there were
two handsome men waiting for her somewhere close, that the moon itself was
closing in on full.</p>

<p class="Story">The jeepney passed
through a narrow row of shops and restaurants, all closed for the night. Empty
hammocks curled in on themselves above the hardwood benches that bordered one
establishment. Sand filled the floor of an empty lounge caf&#233;. Grills were
closed and chained shut; the bamboo counters of bars empty and wiped clean.
There was an Italian restaurant called Angelo&#8217;s and an Indian restaurant called
Ganesh House. A dive shop advertised lessons and day trips to Koh Tao and Koh
Samui in its glass windows. A few of the other shops and businesses were in
fully-enclosed spaces, with windows, but all of the restaurants, even Angelo&#8217;s
and Ganesh House, were open-air. As the truck reached the end of the row it
slowed. It was light now, and Marin heard every small sound that poked through
the quiet of the morning. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Haadrin Beach,&#148;
said the jeepney driver, turning around in his seat. &#147;Walk there,&#148; he said,
pointing towards a sand path that led behind and around a small beachfront
hostel. Marin got out and paid him her fare. The other backpacker had disappeared
already. As the driver restarted the truck&#8217;s engine and drove off, Marin
walked to the sand path that he had pointed out.</p>

<p class="Story">The proportion of
sand in the path soon overtook the proportion of concrete, and Marin took off
her sandals and felt the salt-fine grains shift as one under her feet. She
rounded the corner, and before her was a long stretch of clear shallow water. It was low tide. A few small boats bobbed with the current and tugged at their
anchors. The sun peeked over the horizon, and the sky was every color it&#8217;s
ever been. </p>

<p class="Story">The beach was full
of stray carnage from the night before: ashed-over campfires in the sand; rum
and vodka bottles; cigarette- and swill-coated plastic buckets; discarded
plastic neon-colored glowsticks, their pale torches exhausted. </p>

<p class="Story">A few survivors of
the previous night&#8217;s festivities had stayed to watch the sunrise. They sat on
rugs around the dead fires and listened to house music emanating softly from
the beachfront bars. They spoke in quiet but still-vivid voices. Some Full
Mooners in fisherman&#8217;s pants practiced spinning ropes attached to confettied
rubber balls. Their game was no game, however: that night the rubber and
confetti would be traded in for kerosene and flame.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin spotted
Will. He was sitting cross-legged on a rug by one of the depleted fires alone,
his elbow vibrating as he scribbled in a small black notebook. One of the
rehearsing fire dancers was teaching a girl in a backless halter dress how to
spin the rope. It spun out of her hand and the ball landed in the ash of
Will&#8217;s fire pit. The girl ran to retrieve it. As the girl picked it out of
the ash, she and Will spoke briefly, and Marin could tell from the girl&#8217;s body
language that she was trying to flirt with him. That&#8217;s when Marin remembered
that Will was the enemy. </p>

<p class="Story">Towards the end of
their dinner at Rai Chiang in Bangkok, Ducky had invited all of them&#151;the
Fulbrighters, Yuri, and Marin&#151;to Full Moon with him and &#147;some good boarding
school mates.&#148; Marin had agreed to attend only because Bree and Greg had
begged her to come. Marin had mentioned her Full Moon plans in passing in a
mass email to the entire O/URC staff and had been very surprised when Will had
emailed back saying he <i>&#147;wouldn&#8217;t be immune to the opportunity of some
beachside revelry.&#148;</i> When Marin had found out, from Ducky via email, that
Bree and Greg had canceled at the last minute, citing school and exchange
program obligations, Will had already booked his flight to Penang. </p>

<p class="Story">Against her better
judgment, perhaps, Marin had swallowed all of her misgivings, left a quite
enjoyable Chiang Mai, and traveled to Koh Phangan hell bent on having fun. The
enemy could do or not do, explain or not explain, and come and go as he wished.</p>

<p class="Story">She cupped her
hands in a mime-megaphone at her mouth and shouted: &#147;Will!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will heard her and
turned. He stood and wiped wet sand from his butt. He closed his notebook,
slipped it into a side pocket of his cargo shorts, and smiled as she
approached.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have to admit, I
didn&#8217;t completely believe that you would be here to meet me so early,&#148; she
said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know, I was
excited before coming out here about getting a chance to sleep in, but then
after waking up at five in the morning all three mornings in Penang, I accepted
that my programming is complete,&#148; Will said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, by the way, I
heard from my Thai friend yesterday about the rooming situation. You can keep
staying where you&#8217;ve been staying, or you can stay in the extra bungalow at our
place,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Your place sounds
good,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s right on a
beach&#151;not this beach, another one,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Check-in isn&#8217;t until ten,
though, I think,&#148; she said. &#147;The other guys went to Koh Tao to go diving, but
we&#8217;re supposed to meet them at the guesthouse at seven to go to dinner.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, my place is
just up the beach. Checkout is from ten to twelve. Do you want to drop off
your bag at my place, go find breakfast and coffee, go back to my place to
check out at ten, and then head over to the other place to check in?&#148; Will
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sounds
reasonable,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="last">As
Will led the way towards his hotel, a Thai woman came out from the nearest
building, a two-story restaurant and bar, with a black garbage bag in one hand
and the red plastic handles of a green bucket in the other. She picked alcohol
and soda bottles up from the beach, emptying them onto the sand before dropping
them in the garbage bag, out of sight. </p>

<p class="first">After they dropped
Marin&#8217;s bag off at the ugly little second-floor room that Will was renting a
half-mile up the beach, Will led Marin out another direction to a narrow inland
road which led to a slightly less narrow road which led into town. Nothing in
town was open for business yet, but a few of the restaurants on the main strip
had one or two staff walking around inside, unstacking and arranging chairs,
filling plastic tissue dispensers with tissue, watching tiny TVs or listening
to tiny radios, and eating small bowls of plain congee from scratched plastic
bowls. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Will were
the first two customers of the first restaurant that opened. Their petite Thai
waitress handed them two large spiral-bound multi-page menus. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin ordered toast
and eggs, Will ordered muesli and yogurt, and they each got one iced coffee and
one bottled water to drink. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So is this guy who
invited you here single?&#148; Will asked. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, but I&#8217;m not
sure he&#8217;s interested in me like that,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s head
over heels,&#148; Will said. &#147;I promise not to cramp your style.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, he knows
you&#8217;re gay,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is that a fact?&#148;
Will said. The bottom lids of his eyes swelled slightly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m not outing you
to random strangers,&#148; Marin said. &#147;He guessed when I asked if my single guy
friend could have the extra bungalow. I just confirmed.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And you don&#8217;t
think he&#8217;s interested in you romantically?&#148; Will said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, there&#8217;s a
difference between being interested in and serious about,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I suppose,&#148; said
Will.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin disliked this
answer and the passive-aggressive prompting that had preceded it. Although she
had a familiarity and rapport with Will that she had missed over the past
several weeks interacting exclusively with random strangers, the lack of joy
that Will&#8217;s presence was bringing her reminded Marin that she and Will had been
in a pretty bad friendship rut even before they had gone to bed with each other. </p>

<p class="Story">Eighty percent of
the distance between two people was essentially dead space. One traversed from
the 0 to 20 percent mark with some people so quickly and pleasantly that it was
easy to make the mistake that with enough time and investment the entire
distance was in reach. But there was never enough time. Other people could
never be truly known or trusted, at least not in the way you imagined before
you knew better. When you did successfully probe further into another person&#8217;s
mind or heart, it was always to find something that you didn&#8217;t want to know.</p>

<p class="last">The
waitress brought out their coffee: two glass mugs of shiny chocolate brown, the
fingers of a swirl of sugary milk spreading quickly through each. </p>

<p class="first">Ducky&#8217;s guesthouse,
the Tanstaa Bungalows, was a collection of robin&#8217;s-egg-blue bungalows with
large white porches, some facing a small white sand beach. Will and Marin were
given keys to two side-by-side bungalows facing the hotel&#8217;s small courtyard and
leaf-filled bathing pool. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Mr. Thaksin said
to make sure you know dinner here tonight seven,&#148; the manager Soo said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, we will be
sure to be back here by then,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We have beach
towel and bath towel in the room. Safe deposit box back here, we lock front
room at night. You need any soap, shampoo, mosquito spray, drink, snack, young
coconut, anything, let me know, my wife go have look get you, okay?&#148; Soo said. &#147;We buy much cheaper you buy in town.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, thanks,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;That&#8217;s so nice.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;All my other
friends having hotel here always don&#8217;t know like or not like do Full Moon, so
much trouble, but money is so much,&#148; Soo said. &#147;But Mr. Thaksin is always Full
Moon bringing nice people Tanstaa, a lot money and no trouble. So I make sure
Mr. Thaksin and his guest very happy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They walked to
their new bungalows via a path of round concrete slabs.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Who is<i> </i>this
Thaksin guy?&#148; Will said. &#147;Thai royalty?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just a regular guy
with family money and a junior analyst&#8217;s expense account,&#148; Marin said. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is he paying for
our rooms?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I haven&#8217;t
confirmed lately,&#148; Marin said, &#147;but that&#8217;s what he said in Bangkok.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You run in the
right crowds in Thailand,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess so,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That was not the
kind of service I was getting at my first hotel,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t know
what to say. She barely knew Ducky, but speculated that the kind of guy who
spontaneously bought newish friends champagne on ordinary evenings out liked to
be liked by many, even or especially managers of tiny beach hotels in his home
country. She was surprised that Will was so impressed by Soo and the Tanstaa.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We should go for a
hike,&#148; Will said. <b>&#147;</b>I think there&#8217;s some falls between the two southeast
peaks,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">And so, after
unpacking and changing clothes, they went for a hike together, and it was almost
like old times. </p>

<p class="Story">Following Will up a
slow incline, deeper into the island&#8217;s baby of a jungle, Marin almost felt like
the young woman who&#8217;d lain awake listening to her first orangutan long call and
wondering if anyone had ever known the mysteries of the universe so
intimately. Then she and Will would hike past some other backpackers, who
would smile and say some benign greeting to both Will and Marin at once, and
Marin would bristle at again being regarded as part of a single unit with
Will. </p>

<p class="Story">What was he even
doing here? Why had he horned in on her plans? He was still the same selfish,
repressed, imperious Will.</p>

<p class="Story">They reached the
falls, a small drip of water dripping over a short overhang of rock, stared at
it for ten seconds, then turned around to go down the same path back to the
Tanstaa.</p>

<p class="Story">They showered off
the hike in their respective showers, dressed in the backpacker version of
Sunday best, and met on Marin&#8217;s porch to go into town for the remaining hours
until dinner. </p>

<p class="Story">Everything was open
now: clothing boutiques, caf&#233;s, pizzerias, movie lounges. Excited new arrivals
pulled stacks of Baht from the ATM machine at the crossroads of the two main
roads. Girls in aviator sunglasses and backless sundresses slid and clicked
hangers of fisherman&#8217;s pants and sarongs along metal racks outside stores. Wet-haired farangs stumbled up from Haadrin Beach wanting pizza, while made-up
girls closed out tabs and crumpled tissues onto cold fries before following the
fresh scent of open ocean out to Elysium. Accents and languages abounded:
Scottish, Hebrew, Dutch, French, German, Estuary English, Japanese, Finnish,
Danish, and even the occasional Canadian or American. </p>

<p class="Story">The Koh Phangan
movie lounge was a purely local invention, but, being members of its target
demographic, it required no explanation for Marin and Will. Open-air;
furnished with thick-roped hammocks, benches and platforms covered with Khit
cushions, and widescreen televisions; floors filled with sand&#151;the movie lounge
that Marin and Will decided to patron served fresh fruit shakes, iced coffee,
iced tea, and farang-friendly snacks like french fries, fried spring rolls, and
chicken wings. </p>

<p class="Story">Will and Marin
seated themselves on a small platform at the back, and watched as the young
farangs up front leafed through a thick book of bootleg DVDs for something to
replace the movie whose end credits were now rolling up the screens of both of
the lounge&#8217;s TVs.</p>

<p class="Story">A waitress came to
take their order. Marin ordered a pineapple shake, and Will decided that
that&#8217;s what he wanted too. </p>

<p class="Story">A DVD was chosen
and inserted into the player, and the main menu of the new Terminator movie
came on screen. </p>

<p class="Story">Their shakes were
delivered a few minutes later&#151;a frothy ice-cold yellow liquid that seemed to be
comprised solely of the sweetest, freshest pineapple in Asia; there was an
extra lick of addictive creaminess to the shakes that was either coconut milk
or crack or air. </p>

<p class="Story">Another best
version of a thing. </p>

<p class="Story">Koh Phangan was
different from Borneo and the previous stops on Marin&#8217;s trip. Koh Phangan was
a savvy and opportunistic tourist town with the white-bosomed heart of an
ing&#233;nue. Marin felt lucky to have come here, to have seen, thriving with
adventurous, pretty, hip young visitors, a place that so completely evinced her
own split personality: the farang-friendly cool customer that would always be a
fresh-off-the-boat na&#239;f at heart.</p>

<p class="Story">An atypically
uncritical Will and Marin watched sci-fi exposition play out in blue and black
tones on the TVs. They slurped their drinks, leaving dry, tasteless webs of
yellow-white foam behind. Around them, twenty-somethings stretched legs out,
closed their eyes, rehydrated gravely, and produced late-incubating
almost-laughs in response to the cheesy Hollywood stimuli.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
set her emptied glass at her feet and leaned back on the slope of the blue Khit
cushion behind her. The shifting orientations and allegiances of her young
life seemed, for the moment, blessedly still. Marin let that moment&#8217;s borrowed
largesse pass through her onto Will. Even if all was not forgiven, it was
conveniently forgotten, as conveniently forgotten as a fianc&#233; killed by an
android in a red pleather pantsuit. The Full Moon party tomorrow night
demanded it.</p>

<p class="first">After one and a
half popcorn movies, one more round of pineapple shakes, and one round of Thai
iced teas, Will and Marin left the lounge and walked two blocks away to a
Parisian-caf&#233;-styled coffeeshop, Caf&#233; Deux.</p>

<p class="Story">They selected
sweets to share from a glass bakery display case&#151;a banana-nut muffin, a pain au
chocolat, a cheese danish, and three cookies&#151;and ordered cappuccinos.</p>

<p class="Story">After paying, they
sat down at a table for two with their plastic number card&#151;&#147;23&#148;&#151;and their
basket of baked goods. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you remember
when May made those cookies from the recipe on the back of your oatmeal box?&#148;
Marin said. Using a plastic knife, she cut the muffin, croissant, and danish
into quarters.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh my god!&#148; Will
said. &#147;They tasted like meat! Like ground, unseasoned, undercooked mystery
meat!&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin laughed. &#147;It
wasn&#8217;t her fault: the recipe was literally water, oil, quick oats, and
raisins.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Meat</i>,&#148; Will
said. &#147;I can&#8217;t believe you brought that up: that was a deeply repressed memory
of unadulterated trauma.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well hopefully
these don&#8217;t taste like meat,&#148; Marin said. She picked up a quarter of the chocolate
croissant and bit into the chocolate-filled edge. The chocolate was almost
solid, sticky with sugar, and the pastry was soft, chewy, and perfectly
tasteless. It was a fair facsimile of a French pastry, drawn in the broadest
possible strokes. It tasted like home.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I love that this
is our lunch,&#148; Will said. He ate some muffin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So how is fame and
fortune treating everyone at the O/URC?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fame and fortune&#133;&#148;
Will said. &#147;We gots some plans. I trust Wan. This is real now, you know? The
holy trinity is money, leverage, and vision, and we&#8217;ve got the first two now. And I trust Wan to deliver on the third.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s great,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;I mean, that&#8217;s really telling that you have that much faith in
him.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Because I&#8217;m
normally Mr. Skeptical, huh?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, because you
know his motivations and abilities better than anyone,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">A waiter brought
their cappuccinos and took their number away.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Except Stephanie
Walczek,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, god,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;I almost forgot about her. How did the profile turn out?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It was fine,&#148; Will
said. &#147;There was just one place where she tried to be extra clever and used
curry chicken at the center of this canteen dinner anecdote, when really it was
fried chicken.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How annoying,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Fried chicken is more Malaysian than curry chicken anyway.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s what I
said!&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin picked up her
cappuccino, blew a bean-sized clearing into the foam on top, and then took a
sip. She tasted real milk
and espresso. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yummy! We are
going to be so caffeinated by dinner time,&#148; Marin said. &#147;Ducky&#8217;s friends are
going to think we are manic freaks.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin, before we
meet up with your friends tonight,&#148; Will said, &#147;I&#151;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So sorry to bother
you,&#148; interrupted a pretty Aussie girl sitting down at the table next to them,
&#147;but what kind of muffin is that?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">The girl was with
her boyfriend, a fellow exactly ten percent larger than Will in every visible
respect. They had just arrived on the island that morning and wanted to make
friends. </p>

<p class="Story">They were funny and
nice, and Marin liked watching Will charm them with orangutan anecdotes and his
I&#8217;m-just-another-useless-Ph.D. shtick. The admiration of the attractive
strangers made Will more confident, relaxed, and generous than he&#8217;d been in
months. Two hours at the caf&#233; went by in an instant, followed by beers at a
bar on the beach with the Australians. Then it was six-thirty, the sun was
setting, and Will and Marin had to hurry back to the Tanstaa. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What a big and funny
place the world is!&#148; Will said, as they turned onto the empty road that led to
the Tanstaa. </p>

<p class="Story">As they walked
through the Tanstaa&#8217;s courtyard to their bungalows, a Thai man rushed by them,
carrying four huge tiki torches under his arm. He walked straight out to the
beach, where, to Marin&#8217;s surprise, Soo and his wife were setting tables with
dishes and paper-napkin-wrapped silverware. Above the water, a large white
round had already appeared against the graying blue-white sky. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess we&#8217;re
having dinner here,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">She unlocked her
bungalow door, waved a silent <i>goodbye</i> to Will, went in, and shut the
door behind herself. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin found the
hibiscus print skirt that she had bought at Chatuchak and a cream-colored
camisole in her bag and changed into them. She brushed her teeth; she brushed
out the mane of sun-warped, frayed black threads that was her hair at that
moment and twisted and pulled it into a loose bun at the back of her neck. She
had a new freckle: on the edge of her right cheek under her eye. </p>

<p class="Story">It was becoming
night fast when Marin stepped back out onto her porch. She could smell sweet
barbecue and burning gas and heard the great velvet pounding of the Gulf of
Thailand against the shore. </p>

<p class="Story">Her life was kind
of amazing.</p>

<p class="Story">Will had changed
too and was out on the beach already, introducing himself to Ducky (even handsomer
than Marin had remembered) and Ducky&#8217;s five farang friends. The tikis had been
lit and were close to becoming their main source of light. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin!&#148; Ducky
called out.</p>

<p class="Story">The last and only
time that Marin had been in Ducky&#8217;s company, he&#8217;d worn a blazer all night. Now
he was wearing a short-sleeve polo shirt that showed off the incidental
benefits of the Thai kickboxing that he&#8217;d claimed avid amateur practice of.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m so glad you came,&#148;
Ducky said. He gave her a full two-arm hug, as if they were old friends. &#147;Let
me introduce you to everyone.&#148; First were a blond guy at least five inches
shorter than himself, James, and a skinny redhead, Danny. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Finally, someone
with two X chromosomes,&#148; James said. &#147;I&#8217;ve spent the past four days looking at
six chaps in wet suits.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You guys didn&#8217;t go
to a co-ed prep school, I take it,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What do you take
me for, a barbarian?&#148; James said. &#147;Just teasing, love. I should have been so
lucky.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Danny burped.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Now see, <i>he </i>could
have gone co-ed,&#148; James said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re such a
berk, Jim,&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">Danny laughed. &#147;We&#8217;ve been here an hour and you Jimmed him already,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, okay, I&#8217;ll
stop,&#148; James said. &#147;Just don&#8217;t call me that in front of our one lady friend. It&#8217;s beyond the pale.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s why I love
this guy,&#148; Ducky said to Marin, patting James on the shoulder as they passed
him and Danny. &#147;He&#8217;ll answer to the sickest profanities you can think of to
call him without so much as a shrug, but &#8216;Jim&#8217; he can&#8217;t take.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Next was the
tallest of the bunch, Nigel T. (there was another Nigel in the group), and a
cute Cupid-faced boy with pink lips and ears and a scalp of pale blond fuzz
named William. Nigel T. had light brown, curly hair and big brown eyes with
long, thick lashes. His jaw and chin had the strong, manicured curves of a
violin and were peppered with the black stubs of a would-be beard. After a few
minutes speaking with William and Nigel T., Marin identified (far too accurately,
it would turn out) William as the long-suffering caretaker of the group and
Nigel T. as its inscrutable, consummate alpha.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and Ducky
left William and Nigel T. and circled back round to Will and a tanned young man
with thick dark brown hair and black eyes, Nigel K. Nigel K. was not
unattractive, but he was the unfortunate possessor of a late-twenties starter
gut.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nice tat,&#148; Nigel
K. said to Marin after their introduction. &#147;Tattoos are back in fashion now,
is it? I didn&#8217;t get the memo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t imagine
that the LSE is patched into the body art marketwire,&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not nice guys like
me maybe,&#148; Nigel K. said, &#147;but there&#8217;re some real perverts in Regulation, you&#8217;d
be surprised. Shall we sit down and eat some of this barbecue, then? Smells
bloody good enough, don&#8217;t it?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin and the seven
boys sat down at the three plastic tables set side-by-side in a row on the
sand. On it was a spread to rival that of much more expensively appointed
dining rooms: a large platter of Thai barbecued chicken, a whole deep-fried
bass ladled with sweet red chili sauce, barbecued pork skewers with peanut
sauce, grilled prawns in a shallow pool of yellow curry, vermicelli rice
noodles saut&#233;ed with pineapple and onion, kangkung with garlic, and a bamboo<b>
</b>basket of coconut rice.</p>

<p class="Story">Soo&#8217;s wife lit the
ends of green mosquito coils in small terracotta pots and put one on each
table. Soo poured Chang beer into glasses and set one by each person&#8217;s plate,
along with a cold new bottle of spring water. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky, fine sir,
you&#8217;ve outdone yourself,&#148; Nigel T. said. He picked up his beer. &#147;Well, I just
want to take a moment to thank the brilliant, insanely generous Ducky
Chaluallakorn for reuniting us all on this bloody gorgeous island, organizing
all of the logistics that it takes to get princesses like Nigel &#8216;Elizabeth&#8217;
Keaton to leave the G8&#151;&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Lying and
logistics, more like it,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Nigel T.
said, pointing the lip of his beer at the other Nigel. &#147;And whatever happens
tonight and tomorrow night, we&#8217;re in Ducky&#8217;s country, so it&#8217;s automatically
Ducky&#8217;s fault. To Ducky!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;To Ducky!&#148;
everyone (except the man himself, who laughed and slid his hand once across his
neck) cheered, clinking glasses and drinking.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin ate chicken,
sweet prawns, curry-steeped rice, and bitter kangkung and learned that James
worked in advertising, that Nigel K. had briefly dated a famous football
manager&#8217;s daughter, that all of the boys but Danny had seen a pair of stingrays
on their dive trip, that William&#8217;s father was a judge and his mother a press
attach&#233; of the British Consulate in Brussels, and that Ducky had once dyed the
tips of his hair purple. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So this is your
first time in Asia,&#148; Will said to Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;ve been wanting
to get this group of chaps out here for ages,&#148; Ducky said. &#147;I brought my uni
friends first, five years ago right after uni ended and before we all started
working. Soo had just opened the Tanstaa, and it was just these ten bungalows
here. I brought my work mates two years ago, and my cousins and some friends
and I flew down to Samui from Bangkok last year and did Samui and Full Moon
back to back. <i>That </i>was a crazy week.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Famous last
words,&#148; said William.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know,&#148; Ducky
said, &#147;this place&#133; I&#8217;ve learned not to have too many expectations and just go
with the flow, as they say.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">It was a warm blue
night on the beach. Soo was cleaning off the grill of the barbecue with a
brush. Marin slowly portioned off bite-size pieces of and ate the last cold
clumps of food on her plate. Soo&#8217;s wife came by with two large bottles of
Chang and topped off everyone&#8217;s drinks.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well as long as
Danny keeps his hairy white arse covered this time, I&#8217;m happy,&#148; James said.</p>

<p class="Story">The boys laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, fuck off,
Jim,&#148; Danny said. &#147;You should be so lucky to see anyone&#8217;s arse at all.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You know what they
say&#133; if you can&#8217;t be with the bum you love, love the bum you&#8217;re with,&#148; William
said.</p>

<p class="Story">This line got the
biggest laugh of the evening so far. Marin saw Will stare admiringly at
William. And to her surprise, she was excited for Will. This was good. This
was progress. And they, she owed it to Ducky, who, she realized now with even
greater surprise, was staring admiringly at her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what&#8217;s the
music going to be like at this shindig?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wagner,&#148; said
William, &#147;Liszt, and a little Joplin thrown in at the end to keep things edgy. No, house mostly, I think, right, Ducky?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Different bars do
different things: house, jungle, techno, trancecore&#133; yeah, mainly house
though. Usually whatever&#8217;s hot at Ibiza,&#148; Ducky said, rolling his eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well Ducky&#8217;s
deejaying tomorrow, isn&#8217;t that right, DJ Quack?&#148; Nigel K. said. &#147;Brought all
his records over in a platinum case and everything. No need to be so humble,
mate!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, it&#8217;s my
first time spinning outside of private parties in Bangkok and London,&#148; Ducky
said. &#147;Hopefully I don&#8217;t clear the dance floor.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wouldn&#8217;t worry
about that. You&#8217;ve got seven groupies right here,&#148; Nigel T. said. &#147;So Will,
what do you do?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m a
primatologist doing research in Malaysian Borneo,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Malaysia, isn&#8217;t that
a Muslim country?&#148; William asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, pretty much. So even though Malaysia has beaches as beautiful as this, the all-night beach
rave thing is definitely not happening there,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">The boys laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That would be
amazing, to see a bunch of girls in burkas tripping to Oakenfold on the beach!&#148;
James said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know if I
would feel comfortable being out of the closet there,&#148; William said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well after two
years not dealing with it at all, I finally came out to one of my coworkers,&#148;
Will said. &#147;That&#8217;ll be two out of nineteen if Marin comes back. It&#8217;s a work
in progress.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You came out to
someone else?&#148; Marin said. &#147;Who?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Linda,&#148; Will
said. &#147;And she is more cool about it than I could have ever imagined.&#148; Will
explained to William: &#147;Our coworker Linda is this very religious Christian
Malaysian Chinese woman. Very sheltered and serious: she doesn&#8217;t drink and has
never set foot inside a bar or club in her life. But, she was just one of
those people who get it right away.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">William nodded, getting
it right away.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re a
primatologist?&#148; Ducky asked Marin. &#147;I thought that Bree said that you work in
international development.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I did, I do,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;Will presented on his work to my boss at the Pac Development Bank
two years ago, and then a couple of months later Will made me an offer I
couldn&#8217;t refuse and I hopped on a plane to Borneo.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What offer was
that, cold showers and monkey poo?&#148; Nigel K. asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Cold showers,
malaria, and monkey poo,&#148; Will said. &#147;No, we needed an idealistic Stanford
grad, and she needed to get her hands dirty. It was a good fit all around.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Stanford grad: oh,
so you&#8217;re one of those <i>smart</i> Asian punk girls,&#148; Nigel K. said to Marin. &#147;I didn&#8217;t know we were in such fancy company.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I wouldn&#8217;t say
that, necessarily,&#148; James said. &#147;Intelligence is so vulgar these days.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Then that must
make you the bloody Duke of Northumberland,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Oh,
come on all of you,&#148; Nigel T. said. &#147;Stop being so English and
class-obsessed. It&#8217;s beyond the pale, really.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">The group finished
their beers and migrated to the porch of Nigel K.&#8217;s bungalow, one of the row
which faced the ocean. Soo and his wife cleaned off the tables on the beach,
packed up the grill and furniture, and took them away. </p>

<p class="Story">James and Danny
went inside Nigel&#8217;s bungalow and brought out large bottles of Thai rum, vodka,
scotch, gin, champagne, cola, tonic water, and Guinness beer and a six pack of
Red Bull. Soo&#8217;s wife brought two large stacks of clean plastic tumblers to
them, handing the cups to Ducky and Nigel T. over the rail of the stairs. She
came back with a bag of ice, which Nigel K. insisted that she throw from the
foot of the stairs to him at the top.</p>

<p class="Story">She heaved the bag
at him, and Nigel K. squatted down to catch it: it hit his chest with a smash.</p>

<p class="Story">The drinking was
serious: everyone got a full tumbler of something. Marin&#8217;s was a mix of Thai
rum and cola.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky explained
that Full Moon now drew enough visitors for parties for the full week before
full moon every month, but the night before full moon and Full Moon itself were
always the busiest.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So essentially
there are going to be people out tonight who&#8217;ve been shitfaced drunk for a
week,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Ducky.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So we&#8217;ve got some
catching up to do,&#148; said James.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; said Ducky.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So we better get
another hit of ecstasy for Marin, then,&#148; James said. &#147;Marin, what would you
say to that?&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;d say that
ecstasy is <i>beyond the pale</i>,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">James laughed. &#147;Indeed, very vulgar, indeed,&#148; he said. &#147;Wouldn&#8217;t touch the stuff for a
thousand pounds. Give me a pint of Guinness over some dippy pill any day.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you really have
X?&#148; Will asked William.</p>

<p class="Story">William wrinkled
his lips and shook his head, <i>no</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I want to hear
about Danny&#8217;s hunting trip with Robert Key and Steve Hamison,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, Danny,&#148;
James said. &#147;Tell us: does the best bowler on the planet like to get really
close in to his grouse or keep out in the brush?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K. and James
were both sitting on the porch rail in front of Danny, who was sitting in one
of the porch&#8217;s plastic chairs. Nigel and James simultaneously propped their
feet on Danny&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In and out and all
about,&#148; Danny said. &#147;He&#8217;s very clever like that. William, be a dear and pass
the scotch, please.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin stood up and
walked back down the stairs and onto the beach with her drink. Ducky followed
her, and they walked to the beachfront in front of the last Tanstaa bungalow.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is there anything
more beautiful than this?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin could see the
gray pockets of her planet&#8217;s sun-washed moon. The black ocean moved and broke;
it was deep, mute murder, fear, and life. Marin resisted any call to the
poetic, however. She felt that she currently had the upper hand with Ducky and
did not wish to let it go.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know,&#148; she
said. &#147;Is there?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky placed his
hand on the inside of her wrist in a staying motion. When Marin stayed, Ducky
removed it and quickly stuffed both of his hands into his pockets. He smiled
at his feet. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m
biased,&#148; he said, looking up at her and then back towards the gang on Nigel
K.&#8217;s porch. &#147;Plus, you haven&#8217;t seen Haadrin Beach at sunrise yet.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin didn&#8217;t want
the awkwardness of correcting him. &#147;I guess &#8216;all-night beach rave&#8217; really
means all night,&#148; she said instead.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s the plan,&#148;
he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;This plan must
involve large quantities of Red Bull,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It does,&#148; he
said. &#147;So you had better start making room in your glass, yeah?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yeah, yeah,&#148; she
said. She took a long sip from her tumbler and then followed Ducky back to
Nigel K.&#8217;s porch.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin finished her
rum and cola soon thereafter. Someone refilled her glass with vodka and
tonic. It seemed, to Marin, during intermittent moments of concentrated
self-awareness, that they were being very loud and using increasing amounts of
profanity. Still, both she and Will were enjoying their roles as novelties and
buffers for the close-knit group of prep school friends too much to try to
enforce a more civilized pace or tone on the proceedings. Marin finished her
vodka-tonic, and someone handed her a half-full bottle of champagne and told
her to finish it.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel T. decided
that it was time to go dancing. Will linked arms with Marin on her left, and
Ducky linked arms with her on her right. They started down the slab path to
the front of the hotel and turned right on the dirt road to town. Some of the
boys were singing an obscenity-strewn version of <i>Danny Boy</i> to Danny.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had not been
this drunk for many years. They stopped in front of a store outside of town,
and Marin didn&#8217;t know why. She was occupied currently with trying to return
sensory ability to the nerves in her hands and face. Nigel K. emerged with
three packs of cigarettes. He threw one at James and one at Ducky. Ducky
removed his arm from Marin&#8217;s to catch it.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can I get one of
those?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course,&#148; Ducky
said. He ripped off the plastic, and cracked open the box at its perforated
edge. He slid the ends of a few cigarettes out and held out the box, brown-tipped
sticks extended like ballerina legs in the air, to Will. Will took one, and as
Ducky reached in his pocket, pulled out a lighter, and handed it to Will, he
held the box out to Marin. Marin took a cigarette, and soon Will was lighting
it, and she was inhaling its hot, toothy smile. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin was less out
of it when they got to town, and had sobered considerably by the time they arrived at
Haadrin. The beach and bars there were filled with bodies. Colored lights
flashed onto hundreds of heads and flickering strobes caught tossed hair and
raised arms mid-motion. A bonfire blazed halfway down the beach. The
synthetic beats and candied wails of a house song blared from multiple large
speakers unseen but close.</p>

<p class="Story">Will spoke loudly
into Marin&#8217;s ear: &#147;William and I are going to get a drink: you want anything?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">She shook her head,
<i>no</i>.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;William, hey,&#148;
Ducky said. &#147;Get a bucket,&#148; he said, handing William some 100 Baht bills and
miming the shape of a squat cylinder. &#147;We&#8217;ll be in there somewhere,&#148; he said
motioning towards the crowd of dancing bodies in front of them. </p>

<p class="Story">William pocketed
the money and nodded, and he and Will went inside the nearest bar.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Stay close,
chaps,&#148; James said, before pushing his way into the crowd.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K. followed
close behind him. Nigel T. was next, then Danny, then Marin, and then Ducky,
placing a hand on Marin&#8217;s shoulder as the crowd closed again behind him. It
was dense, dark, and moist as a stretch of primary growth rainforest inside the
crowd. They settled in a spot and began dancing. The boys had some decent
moves. Combined with all the head-craning going on from everybody but Marin
and Ducky, serious skills of coordination were being exercised.</p>

<p class="Story">After about twenty
minutes, Will and William found them and squeezed into their circle. They had
two quart-size plastic buckets filled with ice, straws, and small bottles of
alcohol and soda. William handed the one with a bottle of vodka and can of Red
Bull to Ducky. Ducky took out the can of Red Bull and straws and handed these
to Marin and then picked up and opened the bottle of vodka and poured all of
its contents into the bucket. Marin opened the can of Red Bull, poured all of
it in, and stuck the straws in on the side. Will and William had done the same
with the other bucket. It was filled with cola-brown drink. They passed
around both buckets, taking turns sipping at them through the straws that
bobbed at their edges. </p>

<p class="Story">A good song came
on. William and Danny improvised a routine together that involved a small
mimed cube that was very hot to touch and ended up getting smashed into Danny&#8217;s
groin to the amusement of all. Nigel K. finished the vodka-Red-Bull bucket,
dumped the remaining ice on Danny&#8217;s head, and placed the emptied upside-down
bucket on Danny&#8217;s head like a top hat, to the amusement of all but Danny. Even
more amusing was the total non-reaction of Danny to all of this provocation. He continued dancing as James reached over, picked a piece of ice from Danny&#8217;s
shoulder, and put it in his own mouth. </p>

<p class="Story">Ducky grabbed
Marin&#8217;s hand and spun her around. </p>

<p class="Story"><i>Five hundred years
of global cultural cross-pollination and advancement, and the awkward spin is
still the best co-ed dance move we&#8217;ve come up with</i>, Marin thought as
she turned in a circle.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How are you
doing?&#148; Ducky asked her. &#147;Sleepy yet?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Still okay,&#148; she
said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel T. turned
around and said something to the blonde girl behind him. The girl looked up at
him and smiled. She glanced at their group and said something to Nigel T., and
he laughed. </p>

<p class="Story">There was a
high-pitched flatline beep, and then the music stopped mid-song. The
crowd moaned and booed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Nature abhors a
vacuum,&#148; Nigel K. muttered. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Everyone, this is
Sophie,&#148; Nigel T. said, placing a hand on the blonde&#8217;s shoulder. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hallo,&#148; Sophie
said and waved. &#147;My friend Julie is here somewhere?&#148; she said. She had a
French accent. She turned around, waved her little wave, and called,
&#147;Juliette!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">A tall girl with
soft brown hair pulled up and tied into a loose bun at the back of her head
squeezed into the space between Sophie and William. <i>&#147;Enchante,&#148;</i> she
said, and gave the same little wave as her friend.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel T. and Sophie
began flirting in French, and Will asked Juliette something in French. She
giggled at his Quebec accent, but gave a thorough, serious reply to whatever
he&#8217;d asked her.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Mad apologies
party people,&#148;</i>
a male voice said over the speakers, <i>&#147;where were we again?&#148;</i> The music
started up again, to cheering. <i>&#147;Welcome to Phangan. You are beautiful. Khap khun.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">They started
dancing again, widening the circle to make room for Sophie and Juliette, but
hearts no longer seemed inspired by the limited vocabulary of group dancing,
and head-craning picked up frequency again, in earnest.</p>

<p class="Story">Suddenly, Ducky
grabbed Marin&#8217;s hand and pulled her off into the crowd, towards the bar and
then towards the small road to its side.</p>

<p class="Story">They got to the end
of the contiguous mass of dancing people, and Ducky let go of her hand. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Where are we
going?&#148; Marin asked him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s a surprise,&#148;
he said, taking the box of cigarettes out of his pocket. He removed a
cigarette from it and put it in his mouth.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You have no idea,
do you?&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">He shook his head, <i>no</i>,
and smiled. He slid a cigarette out an inch from the box and held the box out
to her. &#147;It&#8217;s a surprise: to me, to you.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">She took the
cigarette from him.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you never
really talk that much about yourself,&#148; she said. &#147;I feel like I don&#8217;t know
anything about you still.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you know what I
think?&#148; Ducky said. &#147;I think that you are someone who likes to feel in control
all the time.&#148; He lit his own cigarette and took a long drag. He held the
lighter out to her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If I said that I
don&#8217;t smoke, would that confirm your theory?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, there are
plenty of uptight smokers,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, <i>thanks</i>,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m just shy,&#148;
Ducky said. &#147;That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t talk about myself. And I didn&#8217;t mean that I
think you&#8217;re uptight. You&#8217;re not uptight, but you hold yourself a little out
and above.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Let&#8217;s stop talking
about this,&#148; Marin said, waving away the lighter. &#147;And I know how hypocritical
that sounds.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It looks like our
friends Will and William are getting along,&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It does,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;We&#8217;re matchmakers.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky laughed. &#147;What do we win again?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What&#8217;s the Thai
word for &#8216;karma?&#8217;&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky smiled at her
and nodded blankly, annoying Marin. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Do you see that
burnt spot in the wall of that building over there?&#148; he said, pointing to a
blackened square-foot of the concrete foundation of a nearby shop. &#147;Last time
I was here, someone set a bucket of alcohol on fire and threw it at the
building.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I imagine that
this event draws a lot of pyros,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That it does,&#148;
Ducky said. He flicked the tiny wheel and pedal on top of his lighter,
igniting an inch of flame. He released, and it disappeared. &#147;Fire good. Do
you know that song, <i>Tipsy</i>? I have it in my head for some reason.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin really
disliked that so many of the males in her generation suffered from an inability
to spend more than one minute on a topic when they spoke to her. She refused
to be one of the many females of her generation who suffered from the
supernatural ability to read such fickleness as quickness and charm.</p>

<p class="Story">However, then Ducky
kissed her. He tasted like wet ashes and the soured sweat of wine. He brushed
his nose against her cheek after.</p>

<p class="Story">He was full of
wrong rights and right wrongs&#151;that is, the kind of perpetual tensions that
mother that black-eyed child bride, desire. And one could get lost in <i>her</i>
primary growth forest for days, months, years.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
put her unlit cigarette between them. &#147;Gimme a light,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="first">Marin smoked her
cigarette, and she and Ducky reversed roles as they took their time walking to
the end of town and back: he made brief attempts at more serious and probing
conversation and Marin deflected his attempts with changes of subject and
flippant asides, taking care to toke his interest with a double entendre here
and there.</p>

<p class="Story">They were strolling
past an intersection close to the beach when they passed a food stall called
&#147;Mr. Curry Dogs&#148; where their friends and Sophie, Juliette, and a new girl were
sitting around plastic tables eating curry and fries. Marin and Ducky turned
into the eatery and were greeted enthusiastically. </p>

<p class="Story">Danny&#8217;s arms were
laid out on the table in front of him, elbows out, and his head was face-down
on his right arm. Ducky slapped hands and bumped fists with Nigel T. and James
before sitting down in an empty seat between James and Will. There were no
more empty chairs, but William pulled one over from the next table, making room
for it between himself and the new girl. Marin sat in it.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K., who was
on the other side of the new girl, introduced her: &#147;Anne, Marin, Ducky.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky, like rubber
duckie?&#148; Anne said. She was another Brit. She was pretty, with short brown
hair and green eyes, and was wearing a strapless black dress and a braided hemp
necklace with a fake jade elephant pendant.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s short for my
Thai name, Thaksin,&#148; Ducky said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Those horrible
English: always bastardizing other languages,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Not anymore,&#148;
James said. &#147;Now we just bastardize our own. <i>&#8216;Idn&#8217;t it?&#8217;</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just blame the
Americans,&#148; Will said. &#147;That&#8217;s what we Canadians do.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hey!&#148; Marin said. &#147;You shouldn&#8217;t &#8216;misunderestimate&#8217; Americans.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, who needs
proper grammar when you have ten thousand nuclear warheads,&#148; said William.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Wow, you know your
stuff,&#148; Marin said. &#147;I&#8217;m impressed.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks, Mare,&#148;
William said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well, William here
is going to be PM one day, if his mum and dad have anything to do with it,&#148;
Nigel T. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Please, we&#8217;re on the
beautiful beach in Thailand,&#148; Sophie said. &#147;Let&#8217;s not talk about politics.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sophie&#8217;s boyfriend
is a political consultant,&#148; Juliette said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Really,&#148; Nigel T.
said. &#147;And what about your boyfriend?&#148; he asked Juliette. &#147;Let me guess:
doctor?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Juliette&#8217;s
eyelashes fluttered, and she pursed her lips.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Juliette is single
now,&#148; Sophie said. &#147;But up until a few months ago, she was dating a medical
researcher, so very good guess Nigel.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Tant d&#8217;hommes
stupide et aveugles &#224; Paris,&#148;</i> Nigel T. said.</p>

<p class="Story">Juliette smiled. <i>&#147;Oui.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What about you?&#148;
Nigel K. asked Anne. &#147;What does your boyfriend do?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#133; like Juliette,
am also single at present,&#148; said Anne. &#147;What about you, what does your
boyfriend do?&#148; she asked Nigel K., to snickering from the group.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I have many accomplished
friends who are boys,&#148; Nigel K. said. &#147;However, my heart is not currently
pledged to any male or female living or dead.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And the living
dead?&#148; Danny asked, lifting up his face seven inches off the table.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I do have a very
attractive zombie fianc&#233;e,&#148; Nigel K. said, &#147;it&#8217;s true. But she only loves me
for my scrummy, scrummy brains.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Danny smiled,
having gotten just what he&#8217;d wanted, and put his face right back down.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Well if it doesn&#8217;t
work out with her for some reason, I know a few Borneo headhunter folk you
might be interested in,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Will!&#148; Marin
said. &#147;There&#8217;s no headhunters anymore. Tourist cash is all that longhouses
hunt after now.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You all are from
Borneo?&#148; Anne said, her eyes sparking with something that Marin hadn&#8217;t seen
since Penang. &#147;<i>That&#8217;s</i> why you two look so familiar,&#148; she said to Will
and Marin. &#147;When I met Will, I thought that maybe I&#8217;d just seen him around
here sometime over the past two days. But then, Marin, you looked familiar
too, and I know I would have remembered seeing you if it were from today or
yesterday. You were on the BBC!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The BBC?&#148; said Nigel T.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We were working at one of the orangutan centers attacked by Pure Homeland,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m studying
anthropology back in England,&#148; Anne explained, &#147;and my advisor does a lot of
work with the Dayak tribe of Indonesia, so she knows Dr. Galdikas and some
other people at Camp Leakey. I followed the story really, really closely. You
were at the other place in Malaysia, right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Am I the first
person to recognize you?&#148; Anne said, panning her eyes once over the rest of the
silent table in an unflattering <i>horama</i> of judgment. &#147;You&#8217;re <i>famous</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, no,&#148; Will
said. &#147;Far from it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, you are,&#148; Anne
said. &#147;Dr. Whitfield is going to flip when she hears that I met you&#151;of course
I&#8217;ll have to lie a little about where. Is it true that Dr. Mohammed once shot
a poacher in the leg with a tranquilizer gun?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Will said. &#147;That was a long time ago though.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Still,&#148; Anne
said. &#147;You both are so lucky to work with good people who really care. It&#8217;s
just really cool.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you also
studying Dayak culture?&#148; Marin asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My background is
in geography,&#148; Anne said, &#147;so I&#8217;m doing more urban-oriented projects right
now. Rural-urban migration, that sort of thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I used to live in
Somerset<b>, </b>and I live in London now,&#148; James said. &#147;Do you fancy studying
me?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Doesn&#8217;t sound as
if you&#8217;re Anne&#8217;s type, Jim,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And what is that
supposed to mean?&#148; Anne said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;As &#8216;to suppose&#8217; is
to infer a likelihood based on imperfect information, to ask a speaker to
suppose the meaning of his own statement is to presume that he does not know
his own complete meaning, but can only guess,&#148; Nigel K. said. &#147;And as I know
my own full meaning, I cannot suppose it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, bollocks,&#148;
Anne said, rolling her eyes.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Did you perhaps
intend to ask me, <i>&#8216;And what did you mean?&#8217;</i>&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, <i>&#8216;And what
did you mean?&#8217;</i> is what I intended to ask you,&#148; Anne said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I <i>supposed</i>
that you did,&#148; Nigel K. said. &#147;And in this instance my supposition was indeed
correct.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And the award for
most boring conversation topic goes to Nigel Keaton,&#148; said James. &#147;So which
BBC reporter did you chaps talk to?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin told him. He, William, and the Nigels recognized the name.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you keep the
orangutans, but you&#8217;re in the jungle?&#148; Ducky asked. &#147;Why don&#8217;t you let them go
wild? Then they&#8217;re not such an easy target for terrorists, yeah?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We do let them
go,&#148; Will said. &#147;It&#8217;s complicated.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Huh</i>,&#148; Ducky
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I saw something
like this on our news also,&#148; Juliette said. &#147;They, like, are the orangutans
already kept by humans, so they are first must be vaccinated and trained again
for the wild, is that right?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, what she
said,&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">Sophie asked
Juliette something in French, and she answered in French. Sophie nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Can you accept
visitors at this place you work?&#148; Sophie asked. &#147;I think we would like to see
something like this.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Our center doesn&#8217;t
any more,&#148; Will said. &#147;I think you can get eco-tourist packages to stay at
Camp Leakey, but it&#8217;s very expensive.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;ve been
getting a lot of donations, right?&#148; Anne said. &#147;That&#8217;s what Dr.&#151;my advisor
said.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The power of
television,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">There was much
nodding.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;How much?&#148; asked
Nigel K. &#147;How much money?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Will told them. William whistled. Even Marin hadn&#8217;t known it was so much.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;People are so
stupid,&#148; said Nigel T. &#147;So reactionary. If you want to donate to charity,
research causes, plan your giving regularly and rationally. Don&#8217;t just give
your money to some people that you saw on the telly one day, no offense.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;None
taken,&#148; Will said. &#147;I agree.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">There had been no
sunrise on Haadrin for the Tanstaa clique. There had been a second wind of
drinking and dancing (after which they&#8217;d shed Anne and Sophie) and then a third
wind, and then two-by-two half of their cohort had disappeared: Will and
William, and then Nigel T. and Juliette. Marin and the remaining four guys had
been invited at one point by a pair of hyper Berliners on the beach to an
after-party. They had all been holding on for some time for this theoretical
future engagement, only to realize too late that they had no idea where it was.</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky had led Marin
and the other three boys back to the Tanstaa at around four a.m. (although
somehow they&#8217;d lost Danny on the way).</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had waited
for Nigel K. and James to disappear down the hill to the beach before letting
Ducky into her bungalow and letting him get to second base. He&#8217;d been applying
soft, wet kisses to her belly with his warm, slick lips when he&#8217;d turned over
on his back and gone quiet. Her frontal lobe had been throbbing so it had
taken her a full minute or two to realize that he&#8217;d passed out.</p>

<p class="last">She
had possibly woken up an hour or two later to a closed-eyes Ducky spooning with
her, but could have also dreamed that up. Nevertheless, when she&#8217;d woken up
after eleven with large planks of fierce white light plowing in from the sides
of her drawn curtain, Ducky had already let himself out.</p>

<p class="first">Late that morning,
Marin emerged from a long shower and emptied the contents of her bag onto her
bed, hoping to find planted, via immaculate conception, a new outfit that she
didn&#8217;t despise, when she heard footsteps and a knock on the door. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s Will,&#148; the
barely muffled voice of Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">She went to the
door and opened it three inches. &#147;Hi, late morning, sorry,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">He smiled shyly. &#147;Don&#8217;t worry. I think the only people up this morning had pharmaceutical help
last night. So you and&#133; <i>Huh</i>?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>Me</i> and? What about you and&#133;?&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Will smiled shyly
again. &#147;Yeah, we should do post-mortem later. I just came to tell you we&#8217;re
assembling for lunch at Ganesh House at one.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay, I will be
there,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m going for a
quick swim out in back here,&#148; Will said. &#147;See you at lunch.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; she said. She shut the door.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin had sat down
on her bed, her towel still wrapped around her, with the top of a halter-top
sundress in her hands. She rubbed her thumb over the place where the halter
straps were sewn into the bust and saw something that she hadn&#8217;t before. She
tied the straps to each other in a bow and held the dress up by its upper
corners: she had a new strapless dress.</p>

<p class="Story">She had put it on
and was drying her hair when she heard footsteps on the porch and a knock on
the door.</p>

<p class="Story">She opened it; it
was Ducky. Her body felt funny with all that had not found closure the night
before.</p>

<p class="Story">He smiled. &#147;I like
your dress,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Thanks,&#148; she
said. &#147;Is it one o&#8217;clock already?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">A device in his
pocket started playing music. He pulled out his cellphone and picked up the
call, holding up an index finger at Marin and turning around.</p>

<p class="Story"><i>&#147;Hello?&#148;</i> he said. He
walked toward the porch rail and leaned on it. <i>&#147;Yes,&#148;</i> he said. <i>&#147;No,
it needs to handle more than that. No, you need to run it through&#151;&#148;</i> He
looked at his watch. <i>&#147;I&#8217;ll come by and show you. Are you at the Tom-Tom
now? Okay, I&#8217;ll be there in ten minutes. No, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s okay. Okay,
bye.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Ducky turned back
around and put his phone in his pocket. &#147;Sorry, Marin, I&#8217;ve got to go take
care of some DJ stuff. I&#8217;ll see you at lunch?&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Yes,
see you then,&#148; Marin said. He bent over the threshold, pressed a single wet
kiss to her left cheek, and left.</p>

<p class="first">The outer structure
of Ganesh House was painted pink, with a multi-armed Ganesh painted in blue and
yellow on the large column to the right of its entrance.</p>

<p class="Story">Everyone from the
original group except Ducky was seated at a large table in the corner when
Marin arrived.</p>

<p class="Story">Will was recounting
a very drunk James&#8217;s encounter with a Thai policeman from the night before, to
much full-throated, table-pounding laughter from all.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And that, my
friends,&#148; James said, &#147;is how you come <i>this</i> close to third world prison
without doing anything illegal.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, good, Marin&#8217;s
here, we can order,&#148; Nigel T. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Squeeze in, Mare,&#148;
William said, sliding closer to Will to make room on their bench for her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I say we get one
tandoori chicken, one seafood curry, one vegetable curry, three orders of
samosas, three orders of garlic naan, and two dosa,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And a mango lassi
for me,&#148; William said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And me,&#148; said
Will.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And me,&#148; said
James.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And me,&#148; said
Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven mango lassi,&#148; said Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Breaking news out
of Koh Phangan, Thailand: LSE analyst sighted counting to seven without
checking the model!&#148; said Nigel T.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I may not have
gone to Stanford and been an interview subject of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, but I&#8217;m not completely useless,&#148; said Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s debatable,&#148;
said James.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Let&#8217;s
order,&#148; Nigel T. said. &#147;I&#8217;m bloody famished.&#148;</p>

<p class="first">They ordered and
began to eat. Will and William were very much together now. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin could see now that the weaker link yesterday had actually been her and not Will. She&#8217;d seen some truth in their time apart, but,
evidently, so had he. He&#8217;d come out to Linda!</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So I think that
that Anne girl has the hots for your boss, the orangutan chap,&#148; Nigel K. said
to Marin. &#147;Did you see how she got all starry-eyed last night? <i>&#8216;Oh, Marin,
you&#8217;re so lucky to work with such good people.&#8217;</i>&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Fame whores,&#148;
Danny said. &#147;You should have seen how the girls were at St. Andrew&#8217;s when they
heard that Prince William was coming. Bloody ridiculous. I don&#8217;t know how he
puts up with it.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t feel sorry
for him,&#148; Nigel K. said. &#147;His royal highness can have any woman in the world that
he wants.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Trish?&#148; James
asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Of course, Trish,&#148;
Nigel K. said. &#147;She&#8217;d dump me for Prince William in a heartbeat.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Some of the boys
laughed.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I guess that goes
for my Felicia too,&#148; said James. &#147;Although Nigel T. probably has enough in the
bank to hang onto Veruca. What do you think, Marin, is eighty million pounds
enough for a girl or does the tiara trump all?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, well, I&#8217;m in
no position to speak for all womankind,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;There&#8217;s no shame
in trying,&#148; said James.</p>

<p class="Story">She looked at
Will. He was drinking his lassi and looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marrying a prince
comes with a lot of sacrifices, principally to one&#8217;s privacy,&#148; Marin said,
choosing her words carefully. &#147;I actually think that there are a lot of girls
who wouldn&#8217;t necessarily care to take on that kind of public scrutiny.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So you would turn
down Prince William?&#148; Will said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;If I wasn&#8217;t &#8216;in
love&#8217; with him, yes,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I don&#8217;t believe
that for a minute,&#148; said Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it really that
crazy?&#148; she said. She laughed awkwardly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What about a
multimillionaire who was crazy about you, totally completely in love with you,&#148;
said Danny, &#147;and he&#8217;s a nice guy and everything, but for whatever reason
there&#8217;s no chemistry on your end. And there&#8217;s no one else in the picture. I
know that you&#8217;re a real rebel and everything but you would turn a
multimultimillionaire down?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;In the scenario
you just described, yes,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, come on now,&#148;
said Nigel T. &#147;Think of all of the orangutans you could save with money like
that!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Please,&#148; Marin
said. &#147;That&#8217;s no reason to marry somebody.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Everyone has a
price,&#148; Nigel T. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, integrity is
all fine and good in theory,&#148; Nigel K. said, &#147;but I bet we could get you to do
some pretty embarrassing things for a thousand dollars.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, thank you,&#148;
Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Two-thousand,&#148;
Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;<i>No</i>,&#148; Marin
said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Twenty-thousand,&#148;
said Nigel T.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin shook her
head, &#147;no.&#148; &#147;Can you pass the chicken?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;$20,000 in one
night,&#148; Nigel T. said. &#147;This is a serious offer. And I&#8217;m happily engaged to a
very nice girl back home, so you needn&#8217;t flatter yourself that this is that
kind of offer.&#148; He picked up the plate of chicken and held it aloft in front
of her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;And I still
seriously decline,&#148; said Marin, using the plastic tongs on the tandoori plate
to pick up and place a piece of meat on her plate. <i>Where was Ducky?</i></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Sixty-thousand
U.S. dollars,&#148; said Nigel T.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;One-hundred-thousand,&#148;
said James.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;$100,000,&#148; said
Nigel K. &#147;In one day. William here used to work in the Office of Fair Trading<b>
</b>and can draw up a fair contract of trading at the hotel. Nothing illegal. Nothing mortally dangerous.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, that&#8217;s
reassuring,&#148; Marin said. &#147;But no.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Just for your time
for one twenty-four-hour period,&#148; Nigel T. said. &#147;Nothing gross or untoward. And we&#8217;re the ones betting on your integrity here. If you can&#8217;t get through
the entire day doing everything we ask, we keep our money.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, sorry to keep
disappointing you,&#148; Marin said. &#147;But money just isn&#8217;t that important to some
people.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel T. nodded,
but didn&#8217;t seem impressed. &#147;$200,000,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">And that was it. Marin&#8217;s number.</p>

<p class="last">Her
response had been noticeably delayed. &#147;You&#8217;re all insane,&#148; she said, as Ducky
strolled with long confident strides into the restaurant.</p>

<p class="first">The final terms of
the deal were hammered out on the back of three ATM receipts found in various
people&#8217;s pockets. Nigel T. was on the line for $85,000; Nigel K. for $55,000;
and James, Danny, and Ducky for $20,000 each. The bet would commence at four p.m.
and conclude at four p.m. the following day. Will and William would
co-referee, ensure the fairness of requests and their completion, and determine
the winner if it was unclear. Marin could not be required to engage in
violence, illegal activity, or provide sexual favors as part of the wager. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;So what <i>can</i>
you make her do?&#148; Will asked.</p>

<p class="last">&#147;You&#8217;d
be surprised,&#148; Nigel T. said.</p>

<p class="first">They returned to
the Tanstaa, to Nigel K.&#8217;s porch for drinks. William returned from an internet
caf&#233; with two copies of a print contract at three-thirty, which the six
participants signed and dated. Will pocketed one copy, William the other, and
the bet commenced at four. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;For the next
twenty-four hours,&#148; Nigel T. said to Marin, &#147;you will speak only when given
permission by one of us, your five masters. If at some point a third party
attempts to make conversation with you and you have not been given permission
to speak, your answer will be, &#8216;I velly sorry. No speak English.&#8217; Verbatim,
no editorializing. Please practice now. Say your phrase.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I velly sorry,&#148;
Marin said. &#147;No speak English.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;The power of
money,&#148; said James.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We need a name for
her,&#148; said Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ching Chong?&#148;
James suggested.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; said Ducky,
wrinkling his nose. &#147;Yuck.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jyna,&#148; suggested
Danny.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Apt and easy to
remember, works for me,&#148; said Nigel T. &#147;What do you prefer,&#148; he asked Marin,
&#147;Marin or Jyna?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I velly sorry,&#148;
she said. &#147;No speak English.&#148;</p>

<p class="last">&#147;Jyna
it is,&#148; said Nigel T. &#147;If the terms of the agreement are not being violated,
you absolutely can not complain or otherwise indicate your displeasure, and, if
you need to cry, you cannot stop your work to do so. Understood?&#148;</p>

<p class="first">Marin&#8217;s first job
was to clean the boys&#8217; bathrooms while they pre-partied.<b> </b>James took her
down to his bungalow where, as per arrangement, Soo stood on the porch with a
bucket, a can of bleach, a sponge, rags, rubber gloves, and a plastic spray
bottle one-third full with bright blue cleaner.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think maybe you
want change your dress first?&#148; Soo said. </p>

<p class="Story">Soo&#8217;s faith in Mr.
Thaksin had been deeply confused, if not shaken, and it seemed to Marin that
her answer to the hotelier, if she was allowed to give it, might affect him on
an existential level.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You would think
so, Soo,&#148; James said, &#147;but you know women and their impractical passion for
fashion. Thanks, I can take it from here.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Soo left quickly.</p>

<p class="Story">James reached in
his shorts pocket and pulled out, one by one, keys to the five straight men&#8217;s
bungalows. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;One of the Gay
Billiams will be out in a tiny bit to check up on you,&#148; James said. He walked
towards the stairs, placed his hand on the support column, and turned around
for one moment, pausing in thought before he said, &#147;Have fun.&#148; He went down
the stairs and back around the corner to Nigel K.&#8217;s.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin picked up the
bucket and unlocked James&#8217;s door. She went in and, without turning on the
light, walked through the bedroom to the bathroom. There were no curveballs,
but it was still a young man&#8217;s bathroom on a tropical beach. There was mold,
hairs, sand, and unidentifiable stains and smells.</p>

<p class="Story">She could hear them
on Nigel&#8217;s porch: laughing, one-upping each other with daring, with wit, with
vulgarity that was harmless, heartless. She put on the gloves. She wasn&#8217;t too
proud. She wasn&#8217;t anything that they thought that she was. </p>

<p class="last">She
heard Will&#8217;s voice but she couldn&#8217;t make out his words.</p>

<p class="first">It took Marin more than three hours to
finish all five bathrooms. When she returned to Nigel K.&#8217;s, she found that she
was no longer certain if she should go up on the porch or just wait on the
beach for further instruction.</p>

<p class="Story">Sophie and Juliette
were back, with two new girls.</p>

<p class="Story">On the bottom step
was her answer&#151;a short stack of clothing with a note on top: <i>&#147;For Jyna: Wear
Me.&#148;</i></p>

<p class="Story">Marin picked it up
and looked up at everyone on the porch: they were busy; no one needed her. She
took the clothes and her bucket of cleaning supplies to her bungalow. The
clothes were a hot-pink wrap skirt and black T-shirt, a uniform. Printed
across the chest of the T-shirt in hot-pink lettering was a logo: <i>&#147;Tom-Tom
Bar.&#148; </i></p>

<p class="Story">She put the skirt
and T-shirt on. She went back to Nigel K.&#8217;s porch, and they wanted her to go
pick up pizza in town: one large pepperoni pie and one large
pepper-onion-mushroom.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin walked to
town and found the pizzeria. It was packed with people. She stopped a male
server. </p>

<p class="Story">He spoke to her in
Thai. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m sorry, I only
speak English,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You are not
Thailand?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No, China, sorry,&#148;
she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;But you are
working Tom-Tom Bar?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes, it&#8217;s a long
story, can I order some pizzas to take out?&#148; she asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You need order
take away?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;What pizza?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">She told him. He
nodded.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Okay,&#148; he said. &#147;Twenty minute. You leave come back twenty minute.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">Marin left the
restaurant, stopped outside, and waited by the entrance. </p>

<p class="Story">Was she crazy to do
this? Could she really trust these guys? Did she and Ducky deserve a real
chance instead of this far-fetched transaction? </p>

<p class="Story">Night&#8217;s dark glaze
had set. The moon, their collective MacGuffin, was the big white zero it was
every month everywhere. It had no answers for Marin on this night or any
other. </p>

<p class="last"><i>You
don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know</i>. Suddenly Marin understood the
existential horror at the center of the saying: that the closed circuit of
ignorance is impossible to escape without some intervening (and wholly random)
act of third-party benevolence. </p>

<p class="first">The porch people were not sober when Marin
returned with the pizza. <b>†</b></p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Oh, good, Jyna&#8217;s
back,&#148; Nigel K. said.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That smells so
good,&#148; said one of the new girls. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I think that&#8217;s the
pepperoni. You ordered extra pepperoni, right, Brigitte?&#148; Ducky said, taking
the boxes from Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Pepperoni? No!&#148;
Brigitte said. &#147;Sophie, you didn&#8217;t get a one with vegetarian only?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Ducky laughed. &#147;We
got vegetarian, don&#8217;t worry.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Brigitte laughed,
swatting at him. &#147;You scare me, Ducky!&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Jyna, can you
clear the table please?&#148; James said.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin reached over
James and stacked used tumbler glasses. She turned and put them on the porch
rail next to Danny, who had his butt and right leg propped on the rail and was
leaning against the column behind him. She moved bottles and the ice bucket to
the side of the table. She picked up five empty beer bottles and put them next
to the cups on the porch rail. The table was wet and she mimed wiping to
James. He reached under his chair and pulled out a roll of paper towels. She
tore off a few sheets and wiped the table dry with them. Then she got out of
the way, as Ducky put the pizza boxes down on the table. </p>

<p class="Story">She moved the used
cups and bottles to the bottom porch step. Soo walked up with a plastic busing
tray.</p>

<p class="Story">He gave it to her,
and she emptied the used drinking vessels into the sand and placed them inside
the tray.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Come with me. It&#8217;s okay, Mr. Thaksin tell me show you,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">He took her to a
concrete building behind the row of bungalows that faced hers. It was Soo&#8217;s
home. They passed through the living room on their way to the kitchen. There
was a small Buddhist temple in the living room, and a television on a wheeled
table, a plastic shelf filled with DVD cases and old newspapers, several
plants, plastic chairs, and a wicker loveseat. </p>

<p class="Story">The kitchen was the
size of a walk-in closet.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Garbage going
here,&#148; Soo said, opening a door in the back corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin followed him
out of it and opened the lid of his trash can. She saw the champagne bottle
that she&#8217;d drunk from the night before (identifiable by its label&#8217;s missing
upper-right-hand corner). She dropped five beer bottles on it. </p>

<p class="Story">They went back
inside, and Soo showed her the sink and sponge and soap and then went back into
the living room and turned on the TV.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
washed her hands with the dish soap and then washed the tumblers.</p>

<p class="first">When Marin returned to Nigel K.&#8217;s, most of
the party had moved to the beach. One by one, they stripped to their underwear
and ran into the ocean. Nigel T. and Juliette were still on the porch talking
quietly in French. After a few minutes, Nigel T. noticed Marin at the bottom
of the stairs. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Are you hungry,
Jyna?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Juliette looked at
her.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Yes,&#148; Marin said.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel placed five
leftover pizza crusts on a paper towel and combined the dregs of five tumblers
and two beer bottles into a tumbler. </p>

<p class="Story">He placed this food
and drink on the top step. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Finish it all,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="Story">He returned to
Juliette and resumed their conversation.</p>

<p class="last">Marin
sat on the bottom step, ate, drank her whisky-vodka-flat-soda-flat-beer, and
watched the others play in the ocean. It was nearly nine o&#8217;clock. Nineteen
hours to go.</p>

<p class="first">They left for Haadrin a half-hour later.<b> </b>Marin was instructed by Nigel K. to stay and clean up the porch and then
look for a person named Kit at the Tom-Tom Bar. </p>

<p class="Story">All of the bars on
Haadrin were hosting crowds that were packed in shoulder-to-shoulder from the
bar entrance out straight back along seventy feet of beach to the water. A
troupe of fire dancers was spinning fire balls and juggling torches in the
middle of the crowd on the beach behind the bar next to the Tom-Tom. </p>

<p class="Story">At the Tom-Tom,
Marin flagged down a girl wearing the same uniform as her. The girl knew who she
was and led her to the second floor. It was as crowded as the beach. At a
small bar, Thai girls dressed like Marin filled buckets with ice, mixers,
alcohol, and straws and pushed them across the bar to customers in exchange for
cash. The girl found Kit, a young Thai man wearing a Tom-Tom Bar shirt and
hot-pink knee-length fisherman&#8217;s pants, on the balcony watching the crowd on
the beach. Ducky was sitting next to him and thumbing through records. Next
to him was the music system, where a farang was spinning a set. Ducky raised
his right hand to Marin, and then said something to Kit in Thai. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You working
downstairs,&#148; Kit said to Marin.</p>

<p class="Story">Kit led her back
downstairs to a bar that had been extended onto the beach with four folding
tables placed end-to-end. Like the upstairs bar, it was doing steady business
in buckets. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin joined the
line and, despite the simplicity of the task at hand, had difficulty keeping
pace with the other girls. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hurry the fuck up
little girl!&#148; one farang shouted at her as she counted out his change.</p>

<p class="Story">After Marin had
served nearly one hundred buckets, the DJ&#8217;s voice came on the PA system: <i>&#147;And
that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for you tonight. You all have been fantastic. Next up,
making his Full Moon debut, is the Bangkok Baller, the Menace of Manchester,
DEEEJAAAAY QUAAAAAAACK!&#148;</i></p>

<p class="last">Ducky&#8217;s
voice came on the PA, but Marin was trying to hear a customer&#8217;s order and
missed what Ducky said.</p>

<p class="first">After Ducky
finished his set, he came down and asked Marin to leave the bar and follow him
to the beach, where their friends were dancing. Some of them had bucket and
food orders for Marin. She went out to get the buckets first and on the way
back some drunk farang reached over and groped her breast. She was far from
her group so she kicked her harasser hard in the shin.</p>

<p class="Story">Getting the food
took about an hour with all of the lines and waiting. </p>

<p class="Story">There was another
round of orders when she delivered the food. </p>

<p class="Story">The evening went
through several distinct phases before Marin reached her halfway mark at four
a.m. There was a period during which everyone found the music transcendent and
behaved and danced as if participating in a spiritual rite. There was a period
during which the women on the beach became tired of the men&#8217;s lack of
seriousness and broke off for girls-only trips to the bathroom (having Marin
stand in the long bathroom line for people in the group became a favorite way
to &#147;use her&#148;) and walks in town, during which they mainly gossiped about the
men. There was a period during which half of the revelers on the beach were
blacked-out drunk and the other half had lost their buzz. Some people got sick
on the beach, and Marin was dispatched to clean up after four such incidents. Then the too-drunk people sobered up a little, the too-sober people went for another round or two,
and everyone went through another transcendent music phase. </p>

<p class="last">Throughout
all of this, their group, even those without money invested in the outcome,
became quite comfortable with having Marin as a servant, and the limitations of
her role and ability to speak had rendered her effectively invisible at times,
even, it seemed, to Will. People talked about her&#151;negotiated resolutions to
double bookings of her time, for example&#151;right in front of her. </p>

<p class="first">The sun rose at
just before six. Its beauty was cherished by the couples (Will and William,
Nigel T. and Juliette, Ducky and Brigitte, and James and an Israeli girl named
Hadas) and tolerated by the dateless Nigel K. and Sophie.<b> </b></p>

<p class="Story">Shortly thereafter
they went to an after-party at a house on the bluffs that Hadas had been to the
night before.</p>

<p class="Story">They walked a mile
and a half uphill and turned down a private road. Hadas led them through a
vine-covered arch flanked with granite frogs. They walked through a hibiscus
garden to the backyard of the residence of an affluent expatriate couple. In
the middle of the yard was a rectangular infinity pool surfaced with blue
tiles. The view from the yard was a bird&#8217;s-eye of early morning on Haadrin
Beach. </p>

<p class="Story">Hadas greeted the
hosts, a middle-aged couple dressed like yoga teachers, in Hebrew. A
terrier-mix dog ran up after them wagging its tail and barked once at Hadas. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin stepped back
and focused on the dog as Hadas began introductions. She watched the dog run
off under the plastic pool chairs where farangs slept in the sun. She
watched a teenage boy farang in swim trunks shoot it with a water gun. She
watched young people with arms marked with body paint serve themselves from a
round table and a rectangular table filled end-to-end with plates, pans, bowls,
and woks filled with food. </p>

<p class="Story">Nigel T. had
arranged for Marin to wash the dishes in the kitchen. He walked her into the
kitchen, watched as she located the sponges and a large bottle of dish soap at
the sink, and then left her.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin soaped garlic
and chili skin off of cutting boards; scraped grease and burnt noodles and
onions off the bottoms of pots and congealed meat fat off of metal racks;
washed twenty wine glasses, thirty-one mugs, ten saucers, three serving
platters, five bowls, twenty tupperware pieces, and two roasting pans; and had
at least thirty more items to go. </p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K. came in,
sat down at the kitchen table with a glass of orange juice, and watched her.</p>

<p class="Story">A bald man stumbled
into the kitchen and zipped up his crotch. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Hallo,&#148; he said to
Marin. &#147;Can I get a wine glass?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin turned off
the water, picked up one of the cleaned glasses, and handed it to him.</p>

<p class="Story">He took it. &#147;Wut&#8217;s
your name, gorgeous?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin looked at
Nigel K.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel moved his
head to the left two inches and back.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I velly sorry,&#148;
she said. &#147;No speak English.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;That&#8217;s alright,&#148;
he said. &#147;You me pingy-pongy sometime, no Engrish required.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K. stood up. &#147;Okay, guy,&#148; he said. &#147;The lady&#8217;s working. Why don&#8217;t you pingy-pongy yourself
outside?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Whatever, O.J.,&#148;
the man said. He left.</p>

<p class="Story">Nigel K. left and
came back with a mug of coffee and a plate of toast. He placed them on the
counter of the kitchen island. He was smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Take a break and
eat up, Jyna,&#148; he said. &#147;Eight hours to go, don&#8217;t want you to lose your
energy.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin shut off the
water again, dried her hands on her shirt, and turned around. </p>

<p class="Story">She ate toast and
drank coffee.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Ducky and Brigitte
just left. I have a feeling about those two,&#148; he said. &#147;But I had a feeling
about you two, too, so what do I know? The other Nigel and Juliette will
probably be shoving off soon too. They&#8217;ll probably do it doggie style. Do you
know how I know? Because his fianc&#233;e doesn&#8217;t do it doggie style. Thinks it&#8217;s
too vulgar.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He took a drag on
his cigarette. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;My girlfriend will
do it any way, anywhere. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to marry her though.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">He yawned. </p>

<p class="Story">&#147;It&#8217;s all a game,
Jyna,&#148; he said. &#147;All a pathetic, repetitive, meaningless race to the bottom.&#148; </p>

<p class="Story">She sipped her
coffee and remained expressionless.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;You&#8217;re a good listener,
Jyna,&#148; he said. He laughed. &#147;Spend your money on something not totally
boring, okay?&#148; he said. </p>

<p class="Story">He put out his
cigarette on her empty toast plate and left.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin washed her
cup and plate and then returned to washing the remaining dirty items.</p>

<p class="Story">After approximately
half-an-hour, Will and William came in.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I just wanted to
say &#8216;bye,&#8217; Marin,&#148; William said. &#147;I know you can&#8217;t respond.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Marin and I are
telepathically linked,&#148; Will said. &#147;She says &#8216;bye William!&#8217;&#148; He opened and
closed his right hand like a sock puppet next to her ear along with his last
two words.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin smiled
quickly.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;We&#8217;re getting
sleepy so we&#8217;re splitting up our referee duties into shifts,&#148; William
explained. &#147;And Will volunteered to go first. I want sleep, and then a 100
Baht massage, and then a chapter of <i>Midnight&#8217;s Children </i>on the beach.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I&#8217;m kind of glad
we had a reason to stay out the whole time, though,&#148; Will said. &#147;Because
otherwise I would have crashed so much earlier and missed the sunrise and this
here party. It was nice just to end the night chilling by the pool and talking
about whatever with, like, the most amazing view ever.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;I concur,&#148; William
said. &#147;I&#8217;m stuffed, too. Deb is an amazing cook. And I am off to get me some
sweet, delicious sleep. Walk me out?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin finished the
dishes some time later and walked out to the pool area. Nigel K. was playing
fetch with the dog and was twirling its collar around his index finger.</p>

<p class="Story">He saw her, pulled
the chewtoy from the dog&#8217;s mouth, and walked up to her. He pulled her towards
the hibiscus garden.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Took you long
enough,&#148; he said. &#147;Will, Jim, and Hadas are waiting for us in the garden, but
everyone else has shoved off already.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">They walked out to
the garden, where Will, James, and Hadas were asleep in hammocks. They woke
up, and the five of them walked out to the road. </p>

<p class="last">Will,
James, and Hadas walked ahead, talking amongst themselves. Nigel put the dog
collar on Marin and threw the chewtoy into shrubs and weeds along the road
again and again and had her fetch it for him until he grew bored. </p>

<p class="first">There are parts of
the forest in Borneo where the sun has not touched ground in years. In these
dark folds live creatures and plants that have never directly fed off the
Apollonian rays of our closest star. There is life that hides silent and deep
in the dark of the canopy, sustaining itself through the work, chaos, and
motion of other, more adventurous species who fly and bask and gorge so much
that they produce sugar enough to spare.</p>

<p class="Story">Marin wondered
which kind of lifeform&#151;shadow- or sun-seeking&#151;she was:</p>

<p class="Story"><i>I am the daughter
of Walter and Jinny Choo. </i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>I speak four
languages. </i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>I like mozzarella
sticks and gingerbread soy lattes.</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>I&#8217;ve slept with
five men.</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>I have lied.</i></p>

<p class="Story"><i>I have never been
in love. </i></p>

<p class="last">It
was not lost on Marin that she was not the only one on the island washing
dishes and toilets and cleaning vomit off the beach. It was not lost on her
that no one else was complaining.</p>

<p class="first">There were still
six more hours for the five boys to break Marin. They had her drain the
Tanstaa pool and clean it with a mop and bleach. Then she refilled the pool
the way Soo did, by filling buckets of water from the nearest bungalow&#8217;s
bathroom and carrying them to the courtyard.</p>

<p class="Story">Her final task was
to handwash the boys&#8217; laundry in a shallow plastic pan with a bar of laundry
soap on the ground by the drain in Soo&#8217;s backyard. This laundry included a
pile of Tanstaa towels that James had defecated in. </p>

<p class="last">The
afternoon sun was above and slightly west, and there was no shade in the yard. Sunburnt, Marin nodded off for a minute ringing soapy brown water out of a pair
of cargo shorts, but she knew that she had won. </p>

<p class="first">The money transfers were terrifyingly
fast. The boys seemed more interested in getting back to the Tanstaa to get to
sleep. </p>

<p class="Story">Marin herself took
a long nap in her bungalow after and woke up at sunset.<b> </b>She changed
into fisherman&#8217;s pants and a T-shirt and walked to the beach behind the
Tanstaa.</p>

<p class="Story">Will, William, and
Danny were sitting on Nigel K.&#8217;s porch drinking tea and eating tea biscuits
from a torn-open package. </p>

<p class="Story">She slipped out of
her flip-flops and walked barefoot towards the ocean. She stopped on the wet
bank of sand before the water. Marin took in the pale blue sky, the orange
clouds of another day gone, the listless, free, cool ocean that lapped at their
feet.</p>

<p class="Story">Will joined her. &#147;Not too shabby, huh?&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="Story">Beauty and pain was
a cocktail whose taste, once acquired, Marin imagined, was not divested of with
ease.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;Is it all a game?&#148;
she asked. &#147;Life?&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;No,&#148; Will said. &#147;Yes. Sort of.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">Marin closed her
eyes, dug her feet into the wet sand, and tried to imagine that it was snow. She hadn&#8217;t felt or seen snow or winter in over three years. It was the most
impossible idea to conjure here in paradise. And yet, Marin longed for it and
only it: the bare black branches of trees and subzero bite of February Chicago
air on her skin. The truest of whites falling from the sky and stopping time.</p>

<p class="Story">&#147;A lot of it is a
game, and the rules suck sometimes,&#148; Will said, &#147;but they also change&#151;faster
and more often than you think.&#148;</p>

<p class="Story">At that moment,
Marin felt it for the first time in her life with clarity: her power. It was
so clear that it was almost a physical presence within her. It was why she
always got into such trouble. Why she always got such bad advice. It was why
men like these men had made her, at great cost to themselves, a target for
their games. And it was how she would one day be free.</p>

<p class="Story">Then Will left her
alone on the beach, and the feeling left her too. All that was left, all that
she remembered, was the longing to be home.</p>
